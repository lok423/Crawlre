Girls tend to try to gain approval, while boys are more willing to take risks.", "&#x201C;This can translate into girls &#x2018;playing it safe&#x2019; and being hard on themselves when they make mistakes.

    "subtitle": "The primary teachers' union NZEI reports that partnership schools attract two to three times as much funding as state schools. But the Ministry of Education, in its role as referee, has always maintained funding is equivalent across both school types. So what exactly is going on?",
    "author": "Education Central",
    "date": "June 27, 2017",
    "content": ["It appears that when partnership schools were first introduced, the ministry&#x2019;s funding formula, though neutral on paper, was overly simplistic. As a result small partnership schools received more annual funding than comparable state schools. Since then the model has been updated. But so have the formulae for pre-opening funding such that now partnership schools receive less money during start-up than comparable new state schools.", "To understand how all of this works, we have to delve into the details.", "Partnership schools receive three main funding lines. First is their teaching and operating grant. To ensure neutrality of funding this was originally calculated using the total salary and operating costs of all state schools. However the formula was flawed, because not many state schools are as small as partnership schools in their early years of opening.", "This meant the partnership schools that opened with small rolls in 2014, 2015 and 2016 benefited from far more in their teaching and operating grant than similar state schools.<br>\nCompounding this was the impact of guaranteed minimum rolls. These are best-estimates of a partnership school&#x2019;s annual roll used to determine yearly funding.", "Although in established state schools such estimates are usually pretty accurate, in some new partnership schools they proved to have been set too high. The effect of this was to push up their per-pupil funding above that in similar state schools.", "In response, since 2017 the rules have changed so that guaranteed minimum rolls apply only for the first year rather than the first three years, and the formula now generates an accurate match with the funding of small state schools.", "Next, partnership schools must be compensated for the fact that, unlike new state schools, they are not given premises. Instead the ministry pays partnership schools an annual property grant beginning six months before they open.", "Originally, to ensure equivalence with new state schools&#x2019; permanent buildings, the property grant was calculated based on the number of children the school would serve when full. But since 2017 this was reduced so that the property grant is now calculated annually, according only to the proposed roll for that year.", "Because they are untested, new schools rarely open with their maximum rolls. Accordingly, partnership schools now attract less property funding than before, and less than creates equivalence with new state schools. So much less in fact, that in future some partnership schools may have to open in temporary premises.", "The final part of partnership schools&#x2019; funding is their establishment grant. This covers the costs of set-up, and the principal&#x2019;s salary in the pre-opening phase.", "However, although new state schools receive the principal&#x2019;s salary for five terms before opening, partnership schools only received it for two. This finally changed last month so that it is now in line with new state schools, but still large discrepancies remain.", "New state schools attract pre-opening funding for an additional two or three senior management staff for up to a year before opening, as well as the balance of teaching staff for one term. These advantages are yet to be extended to partnership schools.", "So with some mishaps along the way, the ministry has been learning on the job how to fund partnership schools. From this year their teaching and operating grant aligns with the realities faced by small state schools. But their property and establishment grants now put them at a disadvantage.", "Before a new school opens, everything must be in place: from the content of the curriculum, to what shorts students wear for PE; from induction in kaupapa Maori to what number to call when a child is unwell. There are thousands of decisions to be made, from the everyday to the extraordinary.", "The opportunity for a principal to delegate some of these to another salaried person, let alone a team, could make a sizeable difference. Similarly, for a child from a chaotic family, the opportunity for a teacher to visit their home during the term before Christmas could make all the difference between a positive or otherwise start at their new school.", "It goes without saying that funding for state and partnership schools should be neutral. As referee, the ministry still has work to do to create that level playing field. Once achieved then the game can proceed, and the results be left to speak for themselves.", "<em><strong>Source: <a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11882077\">NZ Herald</a></strong></em>"],

Schools will decide how to spend the money allocated.", "The decile system is based on the area from which a school draws its students. But attaching a number to each school has meant some parents avoid lower-decile schools, mistakenly linking a decile number with the quality of education.", "That has led to school rolls falling at some schools, particularly those that border schools with higher deciles.", "&#x201C;This is the shift that we need to make as a nation, to get parents thinking about what is the achievement information of a school, what is happening at the leadership level, not what the income is of particular parents,&#x201D; Kaye said.", "&#x201C;We want to change the conversation as a country to be not about socioeconomic income of neighbourhoods, to be about the teaching and learning that is going on at individual schools.&#x201D;", "Replacing the decile system is just one part of the Government&#x2019;s wide-ranging education reforms.", "The Government is already testing a version of &#x2018;at-risk&#x2019; school funding. Schools this year did not get a general increase to operations funding to cover inflation. Instead, schools get $92 in extra funding for each student from a long-term, welfare-dependent background.", "There is widespread support for scrapping deciles.

Decile 1 schools are the 10 per cent of schools with the highest proportion of students from low socioeconomic communities. Decile 10 schools are the 10 per cent with the lowest proportion of such students.", "Deciles are worked out by combining students&#x2019; address information with Census data for small geographical areas to examine factors, including household income and crowding, and parents&#x2019; occupations, qualifications, and benefit support.", "<strong>Why is the Government replacing it?</strong>", "Education Minister Nikki Kaye says the decile system is too blunt, and advances in data and analytics mean it is possible to use information about each child or pre-schooler, rather than the neighbourhoods in which they live.", "Another key argument is too many parents wrongly equate a higher decile with better quality education, leading to lower decile schools being stigmatised.", "<strong>What will take its place and when?</strong>", "As early as 2019, a new system will be used that allocates extra money according to how many &#x2018;at risk&#x2019; children schools have enrolled.", "A statistical &#x2018;risk&#x2019; index will be used to estimate for each student how at risk of educational underachievement they are.

Kaye says schools have been stigmatised by their decile number for too long.", "&#x201C;Rather than allocating this funding on the basis of neighbourhood characteristics as the current decile system does, the Risk Index will instead provide fairer funding that better reflects the needs of children in our schools and services. This will mean extra resources are better targeted to support schools to lift achievement.&#x201D;", "The specific factors to be used in the index are yet to be finalised, but 16 draft factors include ethnicity, mother&#x2019;s average income, how old the mother was when the child was born, and whether the male caregiver is not the biological father. The factors will be the indicators which have the greatest influence on student achievement.", "Schools&#xA0;and parents will not be told which children are &#x2018;at risk&#x2019;.", "&#x201C;With any system, whether it&#x2019;s with decile or the Risk Index it&#x2019;s very important that children and young people&#x2019;s privacy is protected at all times. The way the system is being designed it will not be possible to identify which children generate the additional funding,&#x201D; says Kaye.", "Kaye confirms that no school, early learning service or k&#x14D;hanga reo will see a reduction in their funding as a direct result of this change and even expects some to gain significantly.", "Teachers&#x2019; union NZEI says while they&#x2019;re pleased to see the back of deciles, it believes more funding is needed to support any replacement system.", "&#x201C;Unless schools and early childhood services get a major and immediate funding jolt, any new way to divvy up funding will be a bit like rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic,&#x201D; NZEI president Lynda Stuart said.", "&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll be glad to see the end of the stigmatising aspects of the decile funding scheme, but the main issue facing schools and early childhood services is a dire lack of funding.&#x201D;", "However, Labour&#x2019;s education spokesperson Chris Hipkins&#xA0;says&#xA0;the&#xA0;proposed system will only serve to stigmatise schools more.", "&#x201C;For example, if it becomes public that your school has got many more parents in prison than the school down the road, which is going to create more stigma &#x2013; the decile funding or that information? I think that information could well create huge stigma for schools,&#x201D; he told <em>Newstalk ZB</em>.", "He agrees that what schools need more than a new funding system, is more funding.", "&#x201C;They can carve it up whichever way they want but the reality is schools are desperate for more money and this announcement doesn&#x2019;t give them any hope they are going to get it.&#x201D;", "Green Party education spokeswoman Catherine Delahunty agreed, telling the <em>Herald</em> that scrapping deciles wouldn&#x2019;t end the stigma unfairly attached to many schools and what was needed was a big boost in funding. Delahunty also&#xA0;said she felt uncomfortable with every child in the country being assessed according to their ethnicity and personal family information, even if the analysis was anonymised.", "Early Childhood Council Peter Reynolds is relieved to hear that&#xA0;funding for early childhood education&#xA0;services won&#x2019;t be reduced.", "&#x201C;While the Government says it is too early to say what the impact of the changes will be on schools and ECE services, it is good to hear current funding to early childhood education (ECE) services won&#x2019;t be impacted as a result of changes to the way schools are funded,&#x201D; says Reynolds.", "Education Minister Kaye says the Government has been working with education leaders, such as those in the Ministerial Advisory Group for the Funding Review and a Technical Reference Group, which have advocated for change and further funding for disadvantage.", "There will be further engagement before any changes are implemented, although it&#x2019;s likely the new model of funding will take effect from 2019 or 2020.", "&#x201C;We are working on a number of initiatives to make it easier for parents to find and assess information about the quality of schools.", "&#x201C;This includes a project with ERO that improves their reports and key information as well as making it more accessible to parents.

Support for working with students with mental health issues was principals&#x2019; largest unmet need for external expertise.<br>\nSchool-wide approaches to student behaviour were well embedded in more schools than wellbeing approaches. Over three-quarters of principals thought student behaviour had stayed positive or improved since 2013.", "&#x2018;Schools where the PB4L programme was embedded across the school also reported well-embedded supports for vulnerable students and other targeted programmes.

We want all young people to think about the future with resilience and hope but instead we are seeing too many young M&#x101;ori falling between the cracks.&#x201D;", "The researchers found that&#xA0;M&#x101;ori youth living in poor neighbourhoods are more fearful about their futures, especially in areas where tribal and community networks are limited and there are few public facilities or places for young people to gather.", "Funded by Ng&#x101; Pae o te Maramatanga, the study enabled Associate Professor Kidman and a team of researchers to talk to more than 100 M&#x101;ori young people in several locations around Aotearoa New Zealand about their hopes and fears for the future. The research included using a technique known as the &#x2018;walk-along&#x2019; interview, where researchers walk with young people through their neighbourhoods to talk about how these communities might change and prosper in the years ahead.", "&#x201C;These young people frequently do not know how to locate information, resources and support vital to their wellbeing and are often pessimistic about their long-term prospects, Associate Professor Kidman said. &#x201C;They are very isolated. Most of their energy goes into getting through each day.", "&#x201C;M&#x101;ori youth are more optimistic about the future when they have access to recreational spaces where they can safely gather and where they can also call on advice from responsible adults and community leaders. In these environments, the provision of structured support and welcoming spaces for groups of youth allow young M&#x101;ori to think in new ways about future possibilities for their families and communities,&#x201D; she says.", "&#x201C;When we began the project we thought we would find a range of views about the future amongst young M&#x101;ori but we did not expect to find such high levels of fear. Long-term economic uncertainty means that some M&#x101;ori young people have trouble imagining a positive and inclusive future for themselves or their families and this is a great loss for New Zealand society as a whole.&#x201D;", "Associate Professor Kidman said the next phase of the research would bring together groups of young people to workshop possible strategies for addressing the problems that have been identified.

The problem is one of several putting intense pressure on school property costs &#x2013; including a growing population, rebuilding from the Christchurch earthquakes, earthquake strengthening and replacing ageing buildings.", "In 2011 former Prime Minister John Key said that an estimated 96 per cent of school buildings modified between 1995 and 2005 had weathertightness issues.", "The following year a survey estimated more than 3000 leaky buildings &#x2013; 18 per cent of all school property by area &#x2013; needed fixing at a cost of $1.4 billion.

We are not exempt from that trend, which occurs because our universities are forced by Government policy to have some of the lowest levels of income per student in the world while other countries are investing heavily to improve their universities and take them up the rankings.&#x201D;", "Executive Director of Te Pokai Tara Universities New Zealand Chris Whelan also cited a long-term decrease in funding as the key issue for Auckland&#x2019;s drop in the rankings.", "&#x201C;Auckland has, long term, done incredibly well competing with big country systems like China and Russia which are spending huge amounts of money to rise in the rankings at the expense of universities like Auckland. It is part of a long term trend, where New Zealand universities are dropping in the top 200 rankings because other countries have better funding than us.&#x201D;", "It&#x2019;s a difficult and increasingly expensive environment, he said.", "&#x201C;On a per student funding basis we&#x2019;re at about 95% of the OECD average. We&#x2019;re 27 per cent below Australia, 60 per cent below England and 90 per cent below the US. We are on a par (in terms of funding per student) with countries like Malaysia, Colombia, Turkey and Brasil.&#x201D;", "Outside of Auckland, The University of Otago, University of Canterbury and&#xA0;Massey University all maintained their performance while the University of Waikato and the Auckland University of Technology both jumped a band. Lincoln University dropped from 401-500 to the 501-600 ranking.", "While the list is important in encouraging staff and students world-wide to come and study in New Zealand, Whelan urged caution when responding to the THE list.", "&#x201C;There is often lots of noise around the rankings and a lot of movement in the rankings. There is a huge number of surveys sent out and you&#x2019;re not sure who answers them year to year. And universities can regularly drop 5&#x2013;10 places&#x201D;.", "Cambridge and Oxford Universities took out the top two places in the rankings, with US colleges dominating with seven American institutions in the top 10. Chinese universities are also climbing year by year and for the first time there are three Asian universities in the top 30 of the THE ranking, under the current methodology."],

Children from low income households, by the time they go to school, have heard 30 million fewer words than a child from a middle class family so that is a huge gap and it portends differences in how those children do in school,&#x201D; Reese said.", "There are a number of reasons for why children in lower income families have fewer words, Reese explains.", "&#x201C;Often it is because families are not as highly educated; or that those homes do not realise the importance of talking to their children. Also it is because some of those households are dealing with higher levels of stress. If you&#x2019;re worrying about how to pay for the next meal or that you&#x2019;ve run out of petrol it&#x2019;s hard to then focus on talking to your children.&#x201D;", "Why do we talk less to boys than to girls?", "&#x201C;We&#x2019;re still looking into reasons why we have fewer conversations with boys. One of the clues to this is we&#x2019;ve asked the mothers in their study in a picture book reading task and what we&#x2019;ve found is that the mothers of these sons were disciplining boys more often, not physical discipline, but at keeping them on task. So the key to dealing with children, both active boys and active girls, is to make the reading more interesting so they don&#x2019;t get so bored. Sometimes, we have longer and richer conversations with girls because they are sitting still.&#x201D;", "Raising and teaching toddlers IS tiring work, but Reese says the more words a toddler has the better their lives are both now and in the future, Reese said.", "&#x201C;Language is important at the time in every day communicating with toddlers. Studies show that children with better language skills are less frustrated as they are better able to express themselves and will have fewer learning difficulties in the future.&#x201D;", "And there is hope, Reese said.", "&#x201C;There are many ways we can improve these statistics. As early childhood educators and as parents and wh&#x101;nau we can improve the quantity and the quality of our speech with toddlers.", "&#x201C;So with toddlers, the really important thing to do is to have everyday conversations &#x2013; to zero in on what they&#x2019;re interested in, not changing the topic to something you&#x2019;re interested in. So they&#x2019;re learning the sounds of language and learning how to take turns even before they can utter any words.&#x201D;", "It is also important to remember that it is not simply a case of children being in a house or childcare with a lot of talking around them, she said.", "&#x201C;Rather than the back and forth between parents or teachers, it really is about the communication between the adult and the child.&#x201D;"],

Our little children are like sponges who soak everything up; they&#x2019;re learning everything all the time. So any time you&#x2019;re trying to apply a judgement, it can only ever be a historical snapshot. Things move on really quickly. So we report to the Ministry, and the data gets crunched into tables, but you&#x2019;re always looking at lag times of up to 12 months, on a centrally mandated set of criteria. You&#x2019;re then trying to make decisions on data that is out of date. That&#x2019;s not good practice.&#x201D;", "Colin says another problem is the lack acknowledgement of context around the standards/whanake.", "&#x201C;We know that all children learn within a socio-cultural context. So that environment, and the people they engage with, and the immense number of variables around an individual learner are significant contributors to the rate of progress in their learning, but these things are not reflected in the reporting.&#x201D;", "Colin is excited about what the changes might mean for the future of primary teaching in New Zealand.", "&#x201C;What I&#x2019;m delighted about is that <em>The New Zealand Curriculum </em>and <em>Te Marautanga o </em><em>Aotearoa,</em> both world-renowned as broad, effective and rich curriculums, can now be celebrated and delivered again across all their wonderful areas.&#x201D;", "Colin says there are plenty of assessment and reporting tools already in use in schools, including PAT, e-asTTle and JAm, among others, and his team intends to continue and expand their use across the dual mediums at Titahi Bay North School.", "&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no debate that we do need to get the basics right &#x2013; literacy and numeracy &#x2013; and primary teachers always &#x2018;go hard&#x2019; on these, but it will be wonderful to have more time to light the fire under all the other areas we&#x2019;ve not had enough time for.&#x201D;", "<strong>Lorraine Taylor is principal of Lynmore School in Rotorua.</strong> She says that while she and her team are happy to see the end of National Standards, she is also glad to see that the new Minister will keep the accompanying PaCT framework available to schools.", "PaCT is an online tool designed by the Ministry of Education to help teachers make reliable judgements on students&#x2019; progress and achievements in relation to National Standards.", "&#x201C;We are pleased to see an end to National Standards.

As a result of the PaCT and the Learning Progressions Framework, we have been able to change our assessment to 90 per cent formative, we don&#x2019;t need to spend large amounts of teaching time on delivering, marking and recording standardised tests.", "&#x201C;It would be very simple to remove references to National Standards in the reporting area of the PaCT and add some new features around progress and reporting.

I believe my experiences and observations in the classroom over the past few years can validate this. I am becoming increasingly aware that it is not the standards that are the problem,&#x201D; he writes.", "&#x201C;The real problem is in the way that teachers approach learning (in general) and how they approach the achieving of those standards (specifically).&#x201D;", "Mark says the standards should not take centre stage in what a teacher does in the classroom, but rather be a by-product of effective teaching practice, and the ideology on either side is merely a distraction from the job at hand.", "&#x201C;Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s not unusual to see political decisions made on ideology and not evidence. The best outcome would be to keep National Standards and at the same time upskill teachers, but that would require investment and honest self-appraisal among teachers,&#x201D; he says.", "&#x201C;I have been teaching for quite a while &#x2013; both before the standards were introduced and after. As far as I can see, the prevalent teaching pedagogy has not changed during that time. Similarly, once NS are removed, you will see no discernible difference in pedagogy.", "&#x201C;The research and evidence is on my side. But &#x2018;group think&#x2019; is very hard to counteract. It&#x2019;s funny how implementing evidence-based teaching makes one a &#x2018;disobedient teacher&#x2019;.&#x201D;", "&#x201C;There is a real need to improve learning outcomes for our underachieving students. Abandoning National Standards won&#x2019;t do it. Charter schools won&#x2019;t do it. Only effective pedagogy will achieve it,&#x201D; he says."],

Record keeping was incomplete and unclear.&#x201D;", "Boshier also criticised the Ministry of Education for failing at the time to provide schools with unambiguous and up-to-date guidance on why and how to avoid using seclusion to manage difficult behaviours; guidance it has since sent to all schools.", "The report was part of a broader investigation into the use of &#x201C;time out&#x201D; rooms in schools, prompted by revelations about a boy who was locked in a cupboard-sized space at Miramar School last year.", "The law has been changed to prohibit the use of seclusion in schools.", "Boshier said that although the law change did not alter what happened to their child, the parents involved in the Ruru case were &#x201C;instrumental&#x201D; in its development.", "The report outlined how the boy&#x2019;s parents first complained to the school in 2014, when they discovered their child had been placed repeatedly in an area he called &#x201C;the little room&#x201D;.", "Built in 1999 with ministry approval, the room was designed to help de-escalate children&#x2019;s behaviour such as kicking and yelling, or throwing themselves on the ground.", "The investigation found the boy was placed their at least 12 times &#x2013; but possibly more as record-keeping was poor, the Ombudsman said. He was transported there in a van, and physically placed in the room, the report said. Although the door was not locked, he would have been unable to leave.", "Despite being part of school behaviour management policy, the boy&#x2019;s parents were not told about it when their son started at the school, and said had they been aware of it, they would not have enrolled their child at the school.", "They described the room &#x2013; which measured 1.3m x 1.8m &#x2013; as &#x201C;barbaric&#x201D;.", "The Ombudsman said it was &#x201C;uninviting&#x201D; and &#x201C;unpleasant&#x201D; and that it was unsuitable in location and for the purpose it was used for.", "Using the room for the boy&#x2019;s behaviour was &#x201C;unreasonable&#x201D;, he said, and the parents should have been told about it.", "He said the ministry did the right thing by closing the room while it investigated, but it gave ambiguous advice on seclusion rooms and took too long to formulate guidelines after the issue arose.", "&#x201C;The recommendation that the Ministry convene a working party to develop national guidance was acted on. However, that recommendation was made in February 2015. The working party convened for the first time in June 2015, but it was November 2016 &#x2013;<br>\n18 months later &#x2013; before the guidance was issued.&#x201D; he said.", "&#x201C;But for the media attention from early October 2016, it may have taken still longer.&#x201D;", "The Ombudsman recommended Ruru provide the boy and his parents with an apology &#x201C;for its failings&#x201D;.", "He also asked for copies of the school&#x2019;s current policies and procedures for incident reporting and the use of physical interventions to transport students, and a report on its most recent audit of behaviour management plans.", "&#x201C;Ruru, the Ministry, and the Education Review Office have made a number of changes as a result of this complaint. I will be following up with Ruru to confirm that the improvements I expect to see around its procedures for behaviour management and for physical interventions with students have been made&#x201D;, he said.", "<em><strong>Source:<a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11944762\"> NZ Herald</a></strong></em>"],

But it will not abolish school fees, which is really what they are.", "Schools such as Auckland Grammar, as we report <a href=\"http://educationcentral.co.nz/hand-to-mouth-grammar-school-needs-donations/\">today</a>, will not take the additional grant of $150 per student. It received $831 per student in fees last year. At the other end of the income spectrum, schools like Edmund Hillary Collegiate in Otara will gladly accept the grant. It receives no fees to give up, it does not ask for them from households that struggle to feed and clothe their children.", "A survey we have conducted of state schools suggests 70 per cent plan to accept the Government&#x2019;s proposal, which must means it is more than they normally receive from parents. Only about 20 per cent of the country&#x2019;s 2531 schools ask for no money so a 70 per cent acceptance would mean the Government&#x2019;s offer is high enough to replace the amounts most receive.", "But The Herald&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://educationcentral.co.nz/hand-to-mouth-grammar-school-needs-donations/\">feature</a> by Simon Collins today also finds that parental fees are not the only source of additional funds for some schools. Pokie trusts are another source they use to finance class trips and equipment that their operations grant from the Ministry of Education does not cover. There will always be a demand for more than the ministry provides. It is human nature.", "In state services like health and education, providers will always want to provide more, for good reason. They are professionals who want to provide the best service possible with the money available to them. The more money they have at their disposal, the more illnesses they can treat, or the more educational aids and experiences they can provide for their pupils.", "When asking parents for their annual &#x201C;donation&#x201D;, school principals always say the government grant is not sufficient to cover the education the children deserve. Of course it is not. It can never be enough. The only check on how much of any good thing we want is the price we are asked to pay. When it comes at no charge most people will readily pay for a bit more.", "That is why Labour&#x2019;s scheme to replace school fees is probably futile. The grant will be built into the schools&#x2019; basic operations and from time to time teachers will want to do new things &#x2014; take a class somewhere special, seize a rare learning opportunity too good to turn down &#x2014; that will be possible only with a parental contribution.", "Parents who refuse, steadfastly insisting education is supposed to be free &#x2014; and every state school has them, including those in well-off communities &#x2014; should think about this. Their children do not usually miss out on the extra opportunities because they should not suffer for the parents&#x2019; view. So the paying parents subsidise them.", "The Government&#x2019;s scheme, if it comes to fruition, will reinforce the views of those who refuse to pay. When they know their school is getting an extra grant to pay for things they refused to pay anyway, they will be even more resolute. Totally free education is fine in principle but ultimately impractical.", "<em><strong>Source: <a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/education/news/article.cfm?c_id=35&amp;objectid=11996056\">NZ Herald</a></strong></em>"],

It&#x2019;s about keeping the school open, using the land for education, so we are supportive of that,&#x201D; he said.", "&#x201C;But it&#x2019;s not exclusive support. As mana whenua, we are not trying to pick sides, we are just trying to maintain the principle of why the land was set aside.&#x201D;", "A key principle for the church has been a&#xA0;<a href=\"http://education.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Ministry/Information-releases/EducationReportConsiderationOfThe-FutureOfHatoPeteraCollege.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">provision in the college&#x2019;s integration agreement</a>that at least 95 per cent of students must be Catholic. Mate Webb, who chaired the college board of trustees when the plan was developed, said that should be reduced to 60 per cent to help recruit more students.", "He said the plan would also need a 25-year lease and extending the age range of students to include Years 7 and 8 as well as the current Years 9 to 13.", "A former Te Wh&#x101;nau o Hato Petera Trust chairman and old boy, Dr Lance O&#x2019;Sullivan, suggested that the school should become a boarding facility only, with students attending nearby schools on the model of Auckland Grammar School&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11821030\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">InZone hostel</a>.", "&#x201C;I&#x2019;m fiercely proud of Hato Petera&#x2019;s contribution to my life and who I am, and in a spirit of gratitude I&#x2019;m very keen to be a part of the future for Hato Petera,&#x201D; he said.", "&#x201C;To be frank, I think that does include the fact that the school will close as we know it. I believe that&#x2019;s not necessarily a bad thing, it&#x2019;s an opportunity to have a blank canvas to start again. That start again has to be different.&#x201D;", "<a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/education/news/article.cfm?c_id=35&amp;objectid=12110912\"><strong>Source: NZ Herald</strong></a>"],

We believe these residential environments will provide the best educational setting for their specific needs,&#x201D; says Hipkins.", "Applications for enrolment will be assessed by independent regional panels, as they currently are for the Intensive Wraparound Service, to ensure that this intensive learning support is provided to those who most need it.", "&#x201C;Criteria are consistent across both access pathways. However, specific guidance will be provided for the regional prioritisation panels to support their consideration of applications for each of the access pathways,&#x201D; says Tracey Martin.", "&#x201C;Once an application is approved, the principals of the three schools will meet to discuss which school would be a best fit for the young person.", "&#x201C;Enrolment applications for residential special schools will be able to be made during Term 3 with the intention that enrolments under the new access pathway can commence in Term 4.&#x201D;", "In order to access residential special schooling a person must be aged 8 years to 15 years (Year 3-10) with social, behaviour, and/or learning needs that are highly complex and challenging, and require support at school, home and in the community. Local learning support services have also been unable to meet the person&#x2019;s needs.", "Martin says the Ministry will continue to work closely with the residential special schools on a detailed implementation plan, so the new direct access pathway is available from Term 4, 2018.", "In the meantime, if parents are interested in enrolling their child at a residential special school, they should contact their current learning support provider or a Ministry specialist."],
