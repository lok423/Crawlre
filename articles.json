Primary teachers and principals have rejected a second Ministry of Education pay offer, and more strikes could be on the cards.","But in the United States, things are typically much worse for some teachers.","<strong>Underpaid and undervalued </strong>","After completing a Bachelor of Fine Arts and a Masters in Arts Education Emily started her job hunt.","&#x201C;The first position I was offered was for a Montessori school over an hour away from our home.&#xA0; That commute would have been absolutely ridiculous, but I thought if the pay was right, as we were struggling financially, I would take it.","&#x201C;They offered me my own classroom, plus required duties such as morning and after school care.&#xA0; My day would have started at 6:30am and ended around 7.&#xA0; I loved the school and really wanted to teach there.","&#x201C;Then they told me their pay: [USD]$24,000. Non-negotiable. My husband and I were absolutely shocked.&#xA0; A person with no high school diploma could easily make more money than that at a fast-food restaurant or grocery store. I am paying over $1,000 a month in student loans alone and it&#x2019;s really quite heart-breaking to know it may have been for nothing.&#x201D;","Emily interviewed in several other districts. She was offered another position for $30,000 per year, but turned it down as it was over an hour away from home.","Her circumstances echo a recent Time magazine feature about the dire pay and conditions for teachers in many &#x2013; but not all &#x2013; states of the US. A <a href=\"http://time.com/money/5387836/teacher-pay-big-misconceptions/\">Time Money report</a> revealed that teachers typically spend between $500 and $1000 a year of their own money on school supplies.","It is also common for educators in the US to work a second or third job to help make ends meet. One in ten AirBNB hosts in America are teachers, according to the report.","&#x201C;Every single full-time teacher I know has at least one other job.&#xA0; They work in restaurants at night, retail stores, private tutoring, etc.&#xA0; Teacher pay in America is just really awful.&#xA0; Teachers are completely underappreciated,&#x201D; says Emily.","After a year and a half of relief teaching and interviewing, the financial strain became too much and Emily sought work elsewhere. She is currently working at Habitat for Humanity which she loves but the student loan repayments continue to take their toll.","Emily is excited about her family&#x2019;s upcoming move to New Zealand. They have sold their house and are working with a migration agent to make it possible.","&#x201C;We looked into many other countries to move to, but New Zealand really just fits us.&#xA0; Or so we think!&#x201D;","<strong>How easy is it for an overseas or returning teacher to gain work in New Zealand?</strong>","In theory, Emily&#x2019;s chances of finding work in New Zealand are good. The Ministry of Education is looking to <a href=\"https://educationcentral.co.nz/govt-aims-to-recruit-400-overseas-teachers-to-fill-teaching-gaps/\">recruit at least 400 teachers</a> from overseas to fill desperate shortages in schools at the beginning of next year.","The feeling among Education Central readers was that while looking abroad might be a necessary step, more needed to be done to help overseas teachers get registered.","&#x201C;They&#x2019;re going to have to fix the registration system for overseas teachers, with the number that have come here in the past few years but gone home again because it&#x2019;s just too hard to get registered. Education Council is going to have to make it very easy for them to get into the classroom once they get here,&#x201D; comments one reader on Education Central&#x2019;s Facebook page <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/EdCentralNZ/posts/?ref=page_internal\">Teaching and Learning NZ</a>.","There is also strong feeling that more needs to be done to encourage returning Kiwi teachers back into the classroom. Both returning Kiwi teachers and overseas teachers trained in hard-to-staff subjects such as science, technology, maths and Te Reo M&#x101;ori are particularly sought after.","The&#xA0;Teaching Council&#x2019;s (formerly Education Council) Teacher Education Refresh (TER) programme was launched for this purpose &#x2013; to help teachers get back into the classroom. <a href=\"https://www.educationcouncil.org.nz/content/sarahs-story\">A case study</a> describes how Sarah, a UK-trained teacher who hadn&#x2019;t taught for 18 years, found the programme &#x201C;a lot of work&#x201D; but beneficial in terms of finding work.","&#x201C;It&#x2019;s definitely something you need to plan for &#x2013;in terms of costs and time commitments,&#x201D; says Sarah. &#x201C;Did the TER help? Yes. Was it a lot of work? Yes. But am I learning a lot? Definitely.&#x201D;","The Government has extended its commitment to covering the cost of teachers completing TER programmes beyond June 2018 and will subsidise TER courses for the next four years.","However, the Education Central chat revealed some disparaging views about the TER programme, with one correspondent describing it as &#x201C;ridiculous&#x201D;.","&#x201C;One of the topics was on the HISTORY of teaching in NZ &#x2013; I think in the middle of a worsening shortage they need to focus more on the present and future!&#x201D;","Another pondered what problem the course was meant to be fixing.","&#x201C;I am active in education and run professional development for teachers. I&#x2019;m told I have to do the entire course as I might not be up to date on Waitangi and assessment.&#x201D;","Former Education Minister Nikki Kaye introduced a fund to pay relocation grants of up to $5000 for immigrants and $7000 for returning Kiwis to up to 100 teachers relocating between December 2017 and June 2018, and a further 100 in the year to June 2019, which has now been bumped up to 160 teachers.","Yet, despite the teacher shortages, and despite the Ministry&#x2019;s recruitment campaigns and the TER programme, anecdotal evidence suggests many overseas teachers or returning teachers are still finding it difficult to get registered and employed.","Teachers on Education Central&#x2019;s facebook page weighed in on the topic, agreeing that there needed to be more emphasis on making it easier &#x2013; in terms of both the process and the cost &#x2013; for overseas and returning teachers to get back into the classroom.","&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a secondary science teacher with years of experience but after taking time out to have kids, have to do an 8 month course to re-register with no student loan available for costs, just to relief teach more than 10 days a year. And I can get part-time jobs [and] better paid jobs in other fields like HR, but I enjoy teaching,&#x201D; shared one correspondent.","Another is frustrated that his Australian degree doesn&#x2019;t translate well in New Zealand.","&#x201C;It&#x2019;s super annoying here [in New Zealand] how teacher preference and pay comes down to how technical your degree was. Because I did a 4 year double degree in Australia I&#x2019;m not seen as specialised, despite doing more educational units than most people. I had Novopay claim my 4 years teaching experience in Australia as 2 years and I&#x2019;m barely off minimum teacher wage ($52K).&#x201D;","Despite the apparent shortage, he has not had any luck with his job hunt here.","&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve applied for 15 jobs, all of them I didn&#x2019;t even get shortlisted. I&#x2019;ve pretty much given up, and accepted that it&#x2019;s either relief teaching for the rest of my career here, or find something more fulfilling.","&#x201C;It&#x2019;s infuriating, because I love teaching &#x2013; but this constant rejection is making me get over it as a career in New Zealand. I love New Zealand, but it&#x2019;s definitely hard to make a living here.&#x201D;","<strong>Understanding the Kiwi context</strong>","Why are teachers like these struggling to find work when we have a shortage on our hands? While it is important not to attribute too much weight to anecdotal evidence, such stories are still relevant. Is the process too arduous and costly? Is the chasm too wide between the qualifications and experience of overseas teachers and what is required in Kiwi classrooms?","President of the Secondary Principals&#x2019; Association, Michael Williams says it might come down to whether teachers are suited to teaching in New Zealand.","&#x201C;For some overseas trained teachers on paper they have the quals but their ability to &#x2018;fit&#x2019; into the New Zealand educational style is difficult.","&#x201C;Overseas teachers who work through the recruitment companies get a lot of support and guidance and we hope that if they don&#x2019;t have the skills, experience and right pedagogical approach the agents will tell them and not take them on.&#x201D;","Managing director of teacher recruitment company Education Personnel Stu Birch&#xA0;agrees it is important to get the &#x201C;fit&#x201D; right for teachers, having experience with recruiting overseas teachers for&#xA0;Kiwi schools&#xA0;since 1997.","&#x201C;We work really hard to put the best teachers available in front of principals.&#xA0;Two of our team are in the UK right now recruiting and interviewing teachers who we know can win a teaching role here and confidently make the move to New Zealand.&#x201D;","New Zealand Principals&#x2019; Federation (NZPF) president Whetu Cormick says overseas teachers do need to come to New Zealand with a willingness to understand the cultural context, schooling context and the curriculum of New Zealand schools.","&#x201C;But even then, they may not be prepared for the realities of teaching our beautiful children in South Auckland,&#x201D; says Whetu.","He says it&#x2019;s up to schools to manage the transition and orientation process into this context; there&#x2019;s no funding or programmes available to help with this.","<strong>Valuing our current workforce will solve the problem </strong>","Both Whetu and Michael insist that in spite of anecdotal stories of teachers struggling to get work, the teacher shortage is a very real concern for New Zealand schools, with very few applicants for positions and in some cases none.","The overwhelming sentiment among Education Central readers is that the best course of action for the Government is to look after New Zealand&#x2019;s existing teacher workforce. Improving pay and conditions will lift the status of the teaching profession, making it a more attractive career option for future teachers. Then it won&#x2019;t be necessary to look overseas to fill our vacancies.","As this reader states, &#x201C;Maybe it would be more sustainable to make the job more attractive for the Kiwi-teacher with the aim that well-trained teacher who left the profession come back and young Kiwis are more attracted to become a teacher in the future.&#x201D;","<em><strong>Teaching Council of New Zealand Aotearoa has responded to this article; you can read their response <a href=\"https://educationcentral.co.nz/response-teacher-education-refresh-programme-is-working/\">here</a>.</strong> </em>","<em><strong>Source: Education Review</strong></em>"],"source":{"name":"Education Review","href":null},"tags":["overseas teachers","pay offer","returning teacher","shortage","strike"]},{"category":"features","title":"Response: Teacher Education Refresh programme is working","subtitle":"The Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand (formerly Education Council) responds to criticism of the Teacher Education Refresh programme.","author":"Education Central","date":"October 3, 2018","content":["In response to&#xA0;Education Review&#x2019;s&#xA0;article <a href=\"http://educationreview.co.nz/why-overseas-teachers-will-help-but-not-solve-new-zealands-teacher-shortage-crisis/\">Why overseas teachers will help but not solve New Zealand&#x2019;s teacher shortage crisis</a>.","The Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand has increased the number of staff who process overseas teacher applications.

The Council has reviewed its processes and ensured that we can assess an application quickly for those teachers who provide required information.","Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand numbers reveal that almost 800 overseas teachers have been registered so far this year. In the eight months to 31 August 2018, the Council received 988 applications from overseas trained teachers to register in New Zealand. Of these 796 applicants received their registration to teach in New Zealand schools. Just 36 applications were declined for not having the necessary qualifications.","In addition to the 800 overseas teachers, a total of 1129 New Zealand trained teachers have successfully completed the TER programme since July 2015. Currently 400 New Zealand teachers are enrolled in the programme. This means that 1129 teachers (with another 400 to follow) have been returned to the profession. In other words, 1500 teachers who were unable to meet the statutory requirements to renew their practising certificates now have, or will soon have, provisional certification and legally be able to work in centres or schools. This is the benefit of TER.","It is also now free for New Zealand and overseas trained teachers to enrol in the TER programme, following the Government&#x2019;s 2018 budget announcement that it would fund the cost of TER enrolment for the next four years.","The curriculum content of the TER programme is contained in four modules.

The phrase has been used for hundreds of years to represent groups&#xA0;marginalised&#xA0;from political, social, and economic opportunities. Today, it has become a maxim for equitable ideals.","&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not about us without us,&#x201D; says Dr Melinda Webber, referring to the lack of representation, in discussions about the future of NCEA, of M&#x101;ori and Pacific learners, those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, and those with disabilities or learning support needs.","The University of Auckland associate professor was one of seven panellists who discussed issues relating to NCEA at Education Central&#x2019;s recent ChalkTalk debate.","Webber is keen to unpack how we might ensure the NCEA review leads to a fairer and more equitable education system. She is particularly interested in how the system can be improved to better suit M&#x101;ori and Pacific students and their wh&#x101;nau, who she says are currently &#x201C;drowning&#x201D; in the complexity of NCEA.","&#x201C;We constantly go to the k&#x14D;rero that talks to M&#x101;ori and Pacific underachievement, but there are many M&#x101;ori kids, particularly in the M&#x101;ori medium, thriving and doing really well. So, what is it that&#x2019;s happening in those schools and how can we emulate some of those practices in our English-medium schools? I think there lies a missed opportunity at the moment to really understand what&#x2019;s happening in those spaces.","&#x201C;The problem doesn&#x2019;t lie with M&#x101;ori and Pacific students and their wh&#x101;nau; the problem lies with the complexity of the programme and the structure of the qualification.&#x201D;","Webber is struck by how little we seem to know about what works for M&#x101;ori and Pacific students and by the lack of proportional M&#x101;ori and Pacific representation in leadership positions at schools.","&#x201C;Our children don&#x2019;t see themselves in the classroom,&#x201D; she says.","Audience member Leonie Wilson has a child with learning, physical and health difficulties. She is also a member of VIPS Equity in Education, a disability advocacy group.","Wilson has been following the NCEA discussion closely and is concerned about the lack of consultation with the disability sector.","&#x201C;The standards were developed by the Ministry of Education with educators and employers; they never looked at including the disability sector,&#x201D; she says.","&#x201C;The NCEA reference group has 60 people. I asked how many of those are from the disability community. Initially they couldn&#x2019;t answer me and then they told me that there were none, so this is how invisible [we are]. M&#x101;ori and Pasifika are also really struggling because of the Europeanised system. Unconscious bias is the politer version.&#x201D;","This invisibility means that little is known about the needs of the sector, says Wilson. She believes the limited funding allocated to schools and teachers to meet the needs of students with disabilities is also a reflection of a lack of understanding.","&#x201C;In the National Education and Learning Priorities, which is meant to be the overarching tie into what we see as important, they said &#x2018;accelerate M&#x101;ori, accelerate Pasifika&#x2019;, which I think is awesome and they provided a bit of resourcing to do that. For disability it was like &#x2018;oh yeah, help them out a bit&#x2019;, so we keep pushing this angle of seeing disabled people as highly capable. There are a few things they can&#x2019;t do but we focus on that and not all the things they can,&#x201D; she says.","&#x201C;I spend probably about 30 hours a week knowing NCEA in and out and co-teaching as a parent and talking to other parents and other people about how to get their children and young people through education, when there&#x2019;s not the funding and space to do it.","&#x201C;Most parents and young people don&#x2019;t want to make waves. We don&#x2019;t want to be that parent and we don&#x2019;t want to make trouble, but in the end you do have to start pushing because otherwise nothing happens.&#x201D;","The inclusion of people with disabilities and other marginalised groups at all levels of the review is key to developing a more equitable model, says Wilson.","&#x201C;We&#x2019;re not going to grow a strong culture, a strong community or a strong future without including everyone in that picture,&#x201D; she says.","&#x201C;All of these things aren&#x2019;t rocket science to do; it takes the political will and impetus to do it.&#x201D;","Webber agrees with Wilson that discussions about New Zealand&#x2019;s secondary school qualification structure are generally about the majority of students who are likely to thrive within it, and should instead focus on designing a system for those who may not benefit from the same educational systems.","&#x201C;When I say &#x2018;M&#x101;ori&#x2019;, she says &#x2018;disabled&#x2019;, and it&#x2019;s absolutely two sides of the same coin. We&#x2019;re trying to put on the table constantly: &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t forget us, don&#x2019;t have a conversation about NCEA without us. It&#x2019;s not about us without us.&#x2019; It gets really tiring having to put yourself or insert yourself into the conversation when it should be assumed that we should be in them,&#x201D; she says.","&#x201C;The kids who are doing well now are going to do well no matter what system you put in front of them, so we need to design something that actually specifically targets the needs of those kids who currently aren&#x2019;t being served.&#x201D;","However, a teacher in the audience voiced his concern about not having the time or resources to provide an adequate learning experience to the gifted students in his class.","&#x201C;I&#x2019;m missing the ones at the other end &#x2013; the gifted, talented, accelerated &#x2013; what will the new system do for these kids?&#x201D;","Mana College principal John Murdoch, one of the panel members, says gifted students may be overlooked for three main reasons: the lack of a universal screening method to identify them; the focus of NCEA on overall pass rates and teaching to the test; and teachers lacking the time to design or research appropriate tasks for these students.","&#x201C;The discussion around equity is one that is very close to my heart for lots and lots of reasons. I think that it&#x2019;s good to talk about what we might do in terms of the &#x2018;big opportunities&#x2019; for NCEA, but really, let&#x2019;s take a few steps back and let&#x2019;s look at what&#x2019;s actually going on.&#x201D;","National&#x2019;s Education Spokesperson and ChalkTalks panellist Nikki Kaye says while there is &#x201C;huge&#x201D; inequity in our education system, this is not a reflection on teachers.","&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t ask the right questions then you&#x2019;re not going to get the right answers you need to develop a diverse system,&#x201D; she says.","&#x201C;Often schools and teachers get the blame for what is going on in the community outside the school gate.&#x201D;","PPTA President Jack Boyle was among the audience members. He is interested in the broader narrative about the equity, evidence and operation of NCEA.","&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no sort of NCEA in a vacuum; it will be contested because people have experienced NCEA uniquely, both as a user or as a provider.

One is that it is not possible to measure teacher performance. I disagree. I have always felt it is broadly possible to categorise the classroom performance of individual teachers as either outstanding, good, adequate or inadequate. The real issues are determining what to measure and how to measure it and who measures it. The key constraint is the time and effort required to obtain reasonably objective data and observations about individual teacher performance.","In the prehistoric days there were school inspectors whose jobs were to observe individual teachers and pass judgement on their suitability for advancement. They also had a more subtle role of sharing best practice and giving professional guidance. This was abolished decades ago. The task of teacher appraisal was then thrown on schools. ERO judges the overall school performance not individual teachers. A losing battle for those schools who struggle to attract good teachers.","But the current incentive structure for individual teachers is sad. For a start, there is little extra time or remuneration given to a supervisory teacher to collect objective data. If a teacher is inadequate in their performance, a derogatory appraisal leads to a disaffected, sullen staff member. If a teacher is outstanding in their role there is no immediate return, just a pat on the back and the likelihood of larger classes and more responsibility next year.","Performance pay has been a toxic subject for teachers because it has been so poorly discussed. There is a fear it will destroy cooperation and lead to a loss of collegiality<br>\nwhich is vital to the job. Yet it need not be so. There is also a justifiable concern about the objectivity of school management in appraising teachers. An inadequate teacher who is a top netball or rugby coach may trump an outstanding geography teacher.","It needs to be clearly&#xA0;defined what is to be measured in teaching. So the current system limps along in a very substandard fashion. Great teachers are either promoted out of the classroom or often leave when they are at their most productive. Shoddily conceived initiatives such as &#x2018;Communities of Learning&#x2019; are used by principals&#xA0; to reward their selected favourites in a de facto system of merit pay.","The unions, particularly under a leftish government, attempt to flex their muscle and regain lost ground in pay and conditions. They are losing the battle and public goodwill along the way. New thinking is needed. Or at least the revisiting of old ideas.","Many teachers are at the top of the pay scale. The introduction of a significant pay increment for &#x2018;expert teachers&#x2019; could be a solution. Teachers who feel they qualify could apply for external appraisal to become an expert teacher. This is not a new idea. It has been floated several times before.&#xA0;They would be appraised over a period by an outside party. The appraisers could eventually be other expert teachers. The title of expert teacher would attract significant extra remuneration and professional status. It would also be limited in tenure.","Such a career path would also remove the necessity of excellent teachers having to move into management to gain significant pay increases. It would also remove some of the risks of nepotism and favouritism in the current system of internal teacher appraisals. Expert teachers could also be seconded to schools that are struggling to perform. This approach has been used very effectively in parts of Canada.","At present poorly performing schools attract a negative ERO report which compounds their woes. There are few mechanisms for remedial assistance. Having access to top teachers who are paid for their expertise would be a win-win. Expert teachers could also be freed up to provide mentoring roles in their own schools.","Teacher appraisal can never be an exact science. But the current system of teacher appraisal is time consuming for all involved with little tangible outcome except the risk of acrimonious disagreement. It is not particularly objective nor empowering. At a national level the periodic outbreaks of industrial disputes just serve to erode public goodwill and teacher status. Poor teachers who fail to improve&#xA0;need to be encouraged to leave the job. Good teachers need to be encouraged to stay in the classroom and remunerated accordingly.","<em><strong>Peter Lyons teaches economics at Saint Peter&#x2019;s College in Epsom and has written several economics texts.</strong></em>"],"source":{"name":null,"href":null},"tags":["Communities of Learning","performance pay","teacher appraisal","teacher pay","unions"]},{"category":"opinion","title":"Mike Hosking: Government’s blind ideology on charter schools doesn’t make sense","subtitle":"It looks like the charter school debate-come-debacle, might have come to a good, and if not good, a satisfactory end.","author":"Education Central","date":"August 30, 2018","content":["<strong>Opinion: Mike Hosking</strong>","&#xA0;","It looks like the charter school debate-come-debacle, might have come to a good, and if not good, a satisfactory end.","All of them, bar maybe one, will get to see another year.","To bring you up to speed if you have not followed the drama, this Government hates charter schools.","Charter schools are not unionised, with union rules, curriculums, and pay details.

No, charter schools are not what they were, or what they really want to be in an ideal world, but they aren&#x2019;t closed either.","Which is what they could have been.","So Labour, to their credit, have backed down having heard the outcry from those who run these places, and there are still only a handful, sadly.

Should it not be <strong>teachers </strong>who embrace the task of, &#x201C;improving our education system&#x201D;?","In New Zealand, formal education has evolved from two policy statements. The first, well over a 100 years old, stated that, &#x201C;&#x2026; for pakehas, it will be free, compulsory, and secular&#x201D; [M&#x101;ori added in 1894]; the second, rather later, stated, &#x201C;Every person, whatever the level of his academic ability, whether he be rich or poor, whether he live in town or country, has the right, as a citizen, to a free education of a kind for which he is best suited and to the fullest extent of his powers&#x201D;. Thank you Dr Clarence Beeby (appointed Director of Education 1940) for penning this for Peter Fraser, Prime Minister, 1939.","Yes, today they need a tidy-up recognising culture and gender, but these statements bear recycling.","Currently, we have an extraordinarily complex National Curriculum Statement administered by a Ministry of Education responsible to the Minister of Education, who, being elected by the people, is responsible for estimating the educational needs of voters&#x2019; children. (This assumes that parents are sufficiently well-informed to affirm government policy.)","Ostensibly, the present education &#x2018;system&#x2019; is designed for students of varying ages, cultures, sexual orientations, financial position&#x2026; to give them sufficient knowledge of themselves and others to cope with and confidently contribute to New Zealand society. No doubt a Mission Statement exists. For those responsible for planning this educational progression, (like religion) it is an exercise of faith or pure guesswork, an ongoing frustration to all perfectionists! It seems that the objectives of the Curriculum are not working for &#x201C;&#x2026; every person&#x201D; &#x2013; which presents an absorbing problem for us all.","<em>Teachers know how students learn</em>. We know about the development of learning across a range of &#x2018;modes&#x2019; (verbal, numerical, and musical, visual, kinesthetic &#x2026; which include creativity) and that experience in all these is essential; we know how to introduce learning at an appropriate level of comprehension starting with direct sensory experience, and possibly leading to metaphoric language or imagery in Year 13; we know that students can learn well one day yet not so well another; we know that some areas or modes of learning will be rapidly understood by a student, whereas a different area or mode can show limited progress; we know that boys can react differently from girls given the same task, and that there can be differences in response between student and male or female teacher; and most teachers know that a student&#x2019;s culture will begin to influence the way he/she learns from around ten years of age (but teachers will not necessarily know how to recognise and adjust to such difference&#x2026;) and so on.","Similarly, teachers have a range of <em>technologies </em>at hand <em>to assist in student learning</em>. However, the speed with which this technology advances inevitably leaves teachers trailing behind. This can result in a dangerous position where the technology developers can dictate to the teachers. Much the same can happen with the production of learning resources which should represent New Zealand, but if produced overseas can thoroughly confuse students if the plants, animals and insects shown are not found here, and more so when they are shown in landscapes lit from the South which is correct in the Northern Hemisphere, but incorrect &#x2018;down under&#x2019;.","<em>Where and what students should learn is a matter of conjecture. </em>Traditionally, we have given little thought to where students receive their education and have provided formal learning by isolating the unfortunate students in special learning spaces called &#x2018;schools&#x2019;, some of which artificially segregate students on the basis of gender, while some schools manage to claim a portion of state funding even though they are clearly not &#x201C;secular&#x201D;.","Students have their individuality squashed by uniforms and rules that can seem strange outside the classroom. The National Curriculum course structure provides a progression of content in anticipation of university study, however, for the less &#x2018;academically inclined&#x2019;, fewer opportunities arise &#x2013; so much for &#x201C;best suited and to fullest extent &#x2026;&#x201D;. Regardless of content, the learning provided by schools is certainly not &#x201C;free&#x201D;. Overall, room for improvement! So much as &#x201C;systematic critique&#x201D;, but reality must be faced.","From the above and related body of knowledge, it should not be too difficult <em>to plan a flexible system for educating a diversity of clients. </em>However, to succeed requires politicians and their servants, the Ministry of Education, to have the vision and wisdom to support recommendations from the professionals, rather than telling the professionals what to do. A creative approach is inherently part of this planning. For example, there will need to be a diametric shift from a competitive model (see <em>Tomorrow&#x2019;s Schools</em>), to a <em>co-operative model. </em>","<em>The physical form of schools may have to change.</em> The use of technology could make them largely irrelevant in their current form and organisational structure, with schooling being undertaken any time between 7.00 am and 9.00 pm &#x2013; learning on demand, possibly from several different &#x2018;schools&#x2019;, or teachers, or homes, or allowing the possibility of parents becoming involved with learning! All of which redefines the role of &#x2018;teachers&#x2019; and how they are trained &#x2013; a separate topic.","So, <em>who can best plan a learning future for our younger students? </em>The answer is surely the professionals who are closest to the students &#x2013; <em>teachers </em>&#x2013; let them have responsibility for their actions! We will need time to gather thoughts, analyse the problem, consult widely (including students), establish goals and ways of reaching them, trial solutions, then adjust and retrial.","This process must allow an interchange of ideas between <em>all </em>sectors of education and encourage co-operation so those involved have a clear appreciation of their particular contribution to every student&#x2019;s educational progression from Early Childhood Education, through Primary and Intermediate, to Secondary, and for some on to Tertiary where &#x2018;life-long learning&#x2019; can be addressed. In particular, educational &#x2018;academics&#x2019; need direct experience in the simple delight of very young students &#x2013; it&#x2019;s called &#x2018;play&#x2019;! <em>At all stages of this planning, the question must be asked, </em><em>&#x201C;How will this learning proposal contribute to the on-going education of every student in a culturally rich New Zealand society?&#x201D; </em>(Beeb should be happy with that.)","Regarding <em>Critical Studies</em>, if the outcomes are practical, such Studies could offer a context for change and sense of direction for educational planning.

This will require radical changes to the development of a school climate, professional learning and development philosophies for teachers, cooperation, discussion and negotiation with teacher unions, changes to Teacher Council regulations and genuine support for improving teaching through compulsory programmes and greater time allocations for non-contact time and PLD time.","But it will result in heightened regard for teachers and teaching as a profession; attract more highly qualified people who are desiring to support our teenagers to prepare for the 21st century, and result in more engaged students with more relevant conceptual knowledge, improved strategies for life, and more capabilities and competencies for lifelong learning and better capabilities to make genuine, significant contributions to society and their own community.","<em>Would you like to be our next &#x2018;Off the record&#x2019; feature?

These include reasonable job security for most established teachers and family friendly &#x201C;at school&#x201D; hours and weeks.","This doesn&#x2019;t mean glossing over the amount of homework necessary to prepare an ongoing diet of food for thought for hungry young minds, nor playing down the undoubted challenges of the classroom, ancient or modern.","For balance, what about a bit of emphasis on the satisfaction of seeing young eyes and minds open and brains develop?&#xA0; Think of Ernest Rutherford&#x2019;s headmaster at <a href=\"http://www.theprow.org.nz/yourstory/ernest-rutherford-early-life/#.W4opAWcUm1I\">Fox Hill School</a>, who first sparked Rutherford&#x2019;s &#xA0;interest in science, watching his protegee&#x2019;s later progress at Canterbury College and Cambridge University.","The intangibles have to be complemented by appropriate salary levels, adequate support staff and opportunities for professional development in a positive learning environment. But salary is not necessarily a big factor at point of entry, though it may be in terms of retention. NZEI ranked salaries fourth on its 2017 <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/96781168/nzei-releases-plan-to-solve-aucklands-teacher-crisis\">10 point plan</a> to solve Auckland&#x2019;s teacher shortage.","Many ex-teachers in all walks of life demonstrate that teaching is an excellent springboard for other things because of the skills and experience gained.","<strong>Organisational Survival</strong>","Reg Revans in &#x201C;The Learning Organisarion&#x201D; says: &#x201C;For an organisation to survive its rate of learning must be equal to, or greater than, the rate of change in its external environment.&#x201D;<em>&#xA0;</em>","Collective pay negotiations are the <em>raison d&#x2019;etre</em> of the NZEI and PPTA and their permanent employees. &#xA0;The NZEI got&#xA0;off on the wrong foot in the current negotiating dance.&#xA0; Shooting itself again in the same appendage won&#x2019;t help its survival prospects.","Perhaps it is time for the NZEI to do some self-reflection and reinvention to enable it to play an enhanced leadership role by building cross-party consensus about the value of education.","Spreading change by positive diffusion, like two gases meeting and mingling, takes time. But being the opposite of confrontation &#xA0;it works effectively at the molecular level.","<strong>Valuing Educators </strong>","In their role as knowledge navigators, teachers are more important than ever in showing learners how to navigate the ocean of information while avoiding the icebergs of misinformation.","Research shows that countries with a greater proportion of the population tertiary educated generally have higher levels of innovation and productivity.

University Entrance is &#x2013; in modern parlance &#x2013; the &#x201C;game breaker&#x201D;. It is the opportunity for young people to access an education that allows them, on average, to earn more than $1.5million above those without a degree.","So how are our teachers/system doing towards providing that opportunity? Well &#x2026; even in 2017/18 it turns out that your skin colour matters immensely. If you are a school leaver of an Asian background there is a 67% chance that you will gain entrance into one of our institutions of higher learning.

A disaster! But in typical adult fashion the current education &#x201C;crisis&#x201D; is about paying people more because there is an apparent teacher shortage. The teacher unions are doing their job. They are seeking the best conditions for their current members. This may well be deserved but it will not solve the teacher shortage which is actually about an extra year of unpaid study &#x2013; not about the ongoing salary earned.","Prior to simply asking for a pay rise the teacher unions need to come up with detailed ideas about how to improve the outcomes for our students of all socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. There is so much excuse-making but the truth is that schools are funded to bring about great outcomes regardless of the home background of the young person.

Those exact words remain in my life forever, which makes me the person I am today. In the heart of Te Urewera forest, I am surrounded by my elders, speaking an ancient language passed down from generation to generation; the history of what our people have seen and heard has impacted on what our land has felt. These experiences make it natural for me to speak my language, recite my genealogical ties to the land and acknowledge those who have come before us.","As I leave Te Urewera, into an urbanised culture, a culture which does not acknowledge the nation who once occupied the land we now know as New Zealand, this brings me to the question I constantly ask myself: &#x2018;should Te Reo M&#x101;ori and Aotearoa history be taught in all schools?&#x2019;","August 1, 1987 was the day Te Reo M&#x101;ori was recognised as an official language of New Zealand. From that day to the present day, M&#x101;ori strive to uphold customs, traditions, history and the language of our people. There has been a tremendous decline in M&#x101;ori speaking pupils throughout New Zealand due to colonisation.","Te Reo M&#x101;ori has close ties to languages from all Polynesian Islands. When Captain Cook first sailed to Aotearoa, he brought along a man named Tupaia from Tahiti who was able to understand and communicate with M&#x101;ori people. This was the first time M&#x101;ori had been identified as M&#x101;ori.","An uncle of mine, Hohepa Tamehana once said, &#x201C;Culture is the essence of our being, it is the voice of our ancestors, the cries of our grandfathers, the anger of our fathers and the strength of our children.&#x201D;","Which I understand the meaning to be: in ancient times, our culture was not something that was taught, it was something that was embedded from generation to generation. When colonisation began our elders would cry and become remorseful due to the deterioration of our cultural practices and our language within the education system. Through times of remorse, anger would arise and be the foundational drive for the revival of our cultural identity for generations to come.","On the arrival of early settlers, M&#x101;ori taught their own language to enable them to communicate and trade with each other. At the signing of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the Treaty of Waitangi, the English Government did not allow M&#x101;ori to speak their own language which forced the decline of Te Reo M&#x101;ori speakers.","However, M&#x101;ori were able to retain their language for the future.

However, within the wider community, Te Reo lacks the encouragement of media, with only a minority of media promoting Te Reo M&#x101;ori. There is a majority that discourages the use of Te Reo M&#x101;ori.","M&#x101;ori culture has received enough discrimination. People who discriminate M&#x101;ori have not had a sense of belonging and cultural identity within themselves, which is unfortunate due to the fact that Te Reo M&#x101;ori and M&#x101;ori culture has prestige and essential power. I believe Te Reo M&#x101;ori should be embedded in all Aotearoa citizens as well as the natural history of Aotearoa because it will definitely enhance the partnership between both parties and also ensure we adhere to the Te Tiriti o Waitangi.","Ko Te Reo te Mauri o te Mana M&#x101;ori.","The Language is the Life Force of Mana M&#x101;ori."],"source":{"name":null,"href":null},"tags":["language","Māori Language Week","te reo","Te Wiki o te Reo Māori"]},{"category":"opinion","title":"Opinion: Camilla Highfield – Let’s not put the cart before the horse in NCEA Review","subtitle":"Camilla Highfield is the director of Team Solutions - the professional development provider of University of Auckland’s Faculty of Education and Social Work.","author":"Education Central","date":"September 17, 2018","content":["With educational organisations all over New Zealand making their submissions on the review of NCEA, we have a rare opportunity to look deeply at our education system and ask ourselves what we&#x2019;re really trying to achieve when we assess student work, and if what we are teaching them is even worth assessing.","New Zealand and international evidence shows that in testing-intensive jurisdictions there&#x2019;s a real danger of putting the cart before the horse when assessing students by making the test the point of the learning. This can create a pernicious idea that learning is something that only happens with a teacher while you&#x2019;re sitting at a desk in a classroom, and the only type of assessment that has validity are examinations testing students&#x2019; ability to memorise content.","There are plenty of examples of exceptional teaching and learning happening in our schools but many of our students are also engaging with interesting material in creative and future-focused ways. What we need is a qualification system that rewards and acknowledges the range of knowledge and competencies of our young people so they all gain a solid foundation on which to build their lives.","A continued focus on the traditional 20<sup>th</sup> century approaches will result in a system that doesn&#x2019;t allow time and recognition for learning that happens across curricular and outside the classroom. We&#x2019;re educating human beings; the goal should be to support our young people to become well-rounded people who work diligently to create lives they can enjoy, who are curious about the world, and who are engaged with their communities.","That&#x2019;s not to say that we don&#x2019;t need ways of measuring student performance against standards and criteria. We need a system that clearly outlines the key skills required for success. But, we need to make sure that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re actually testing for because right now the overwhelming focus on test scores and obtaining credits is driven by the desire to create robust entry criteria for tertiary courses.","So, what would I like NCEA to look like? I&#x2019;d like to continue the flexibility the current qualification allows but broaden the types of learning it recognises and what counts as evidence of learning. The current assessment methodology relies heavily on teacher knowledge and examinations to assess a narrow set of skills that are increasingly becoming redundant. If a student comes to a teacher to show them an app they&#x2019;ve developed in their free time, isn&#x2019;t that evidence of learning? And if it is, then shouldn&#x2019;t our system recognise it?","There are definitely fundamental critical skills and knowledge that NCEA standards assess which must be retained. We know critical literacy and numeracy skills are important for leading a successful life, students need teaching that helps them develop these skills and not structures that allow avoidance. Students need to understand the non-negotiables required to gain their qualification as well as having opportunities to develop and be rewarded for their passions and interests.","We certainly require a system that allows students from all ethnicities and backgrounds to aim to be doctors, engineers, computer coders and scientists, which are vital roles in society, but we also know that many of our students want to engage in trades and creative industries and require a platform from which to build their future in ways that haven&#x2019;t been fully explored yet.","New Zealand will be a better place for producing a generation of young people who feel that they have a formal qualification that recognises all aspects of their knowledge and competencies.

Children who have access to the arts begin to understand and value the power of the imagination.&#xA0; Children who learn to love the arts become adults whose lives are enriched by poetry, dance, music, theatre, and mixed media.&#xA0; They see the possibility and validity of a career in the arts for themselves. Graduates from university courses in the arts have the soft skills increasingly valued by employers:&#xA0; creativity, flexibility, a willingness and ability to think and act with an artist&#x2019;s mind and body.","Yet learning in the arts teach you that there is more to life than work. As children and young people learn in the arts they make beautiful things, they move gracefully with others, they blend their voices in harmony. With a stroke of a brush they create something new, something never seen before.&#xA0; Making art makes children&#x2019;s friends and families lives lighter and easier through their performances, in their gifts of the art they make.","The arts are important in schools not just because of these things. They are valuable in and of themselves.","The arts are as vital in schools as they are everywhere else because the arts are carriers of hope. In a country where we have one of the highest youth suicide rates in the world, having the arts awaken young people to the possibilities of joy, of wonder and beauty is not a luxury. The arts are the processes all cultures use to make sense of the worlds in which we live and provide us with the tools to imagine what they might be. In this way the arts must be the heartbeat of education. We need an alive education system committed to making new generations of artists so we can reimagine our history, our present and our future. Out of our griefs for the past and our dreams of the future we remake who we are.","We know the arts therefore should be a basic right in every school, not driven to the edges of universities and tertiary education, something that comes and goes on the whim of individual principals and Vice chancellors driven by the dictates of a misunderstanding of the importance of STEM industries.","I was the National Coordinator for Drama with the Ministry of Education overseeing the introduction of the Arts curriculum when it was made compulsory in 2003. A previous Minister of the Arts, who was also a Prime Minister, invested over $15million into growing the arts in schools.&#xA0; During that time the Arts were the fastest growing subjects at senior secondary level and beginning to grow at primary level. And yet now they have all but disappeared in our schools, in our university teacher training programmes and are under enormous threat within our universities. They have disappeared within a Ministry of Education which has no idea or interest in the arts or creativity, and what they mean to us as individuals or as a nation. I have recently been invited to speak to school principal groups around the country. When I speak of the arts there is often a wistful look, an acknowledgment that they have been surrendered. When I suggested in Dunedin recently that the arts might be the biggest winner in the current government&#x2019;s reforms of education, the principals stood in spontaneous prolonged applause.","The arts also remind us that schooling is a public good. Education philosopher Martha Nussbaum argues that the death of the arts in schools and universities (especially with the focus on STEM subjects) is a threat to global democracy.&#xA0; The arts provide us with the capacity to imagine and feel what it is to be the other. At a time in history where some world leaders deliberately feed on our fears of the other, empathy becomes the key competency of 21st century living. For without empathy, fundamental beliefs reduce our humanity. Terror and despair replaces hope. If we are to survive the coming years, it will be because we learn to live together and to empathise with each other. It will be through acknowledging and respecting our collective and individual humanity through the arts.","Seamus Heaney wrote","<em>History says, don&#x2019;t hope<br>\nOn this side of the grave.<br>\nBut then, once in a lifetime<br>\nThe longed-for tidal wave<br>\nOf justice can rise up,<br>\nAnd hope and history rhyme.</em>","So hope for a great sea-change<br>\nOn the far side of revenge.<br>\nBelieve that further shore<br>\nIs reachable from here.<br>\nBelieve in miracle<br>\nAnd cures and healing wells.","There is hope for a sea change for education.&#xA0; How our best artists and creative thinkers might work to reshape our education system; how we might successfully build partnerships between the creative industries and schools; how we make our universities and schools more responsive to the power of the arts so we might tell our stories to ourselves and the world is the real possibility of deep and abiding change.

Nowadays the thousands of women who enrol in New Zealand&#x2019;s eight universities and its polytechnics and w&#x101;nanga no longer disguise their gender, as Edger had to when she enrolled.","Female tertiary education participation rates between the ages of 16 to 64 are at 13.5 per cent compared with 9.7 per cent for men, according to the Ministry of Education. Women&#x2019;s increased education levels over the past 125 years are a triumphant expression of women&#x2019;s progress. With it has come increasing feminisation of professional and public life, improved family outcomes and an erosion of sex discrimination in workplaces.","But what&#x2019;s the status of women in New Zealand universities, not as students, but as academic and professional leaders? Evidence reveals slow progress only.","We now have three of eight universities with female vice-chancellors, with the University of Canterbury joining Otago and Massey. But the figures for the proportion of women academics at the top remain unacceptable. In 2017, the Ministry of Education reported that only 26 per cent of professors and deans at the eight universities were women. In 2012, the New Zealand Human Rights Commission&#x2019;s census figures calculated that female professors constituted 19 per cent of the total number of senior academics at this level.","Progress in closing the gap is not good enough and in stark contrast to the gendered profile of the workforce. Just over half, 51 per cent, of academic staff at public tertiary education providers were women in 2017. Like other professions, equal pay and gender pay gaps are linked to poor female representation at the top of the academy.","The university sector is trying to redress gender inequity. The New Zealand Women in Leadership (NZWiL) programme celebrates its 12th birthday this year and has 473 female alumni, 258 academic and 215 professional staff women, many of whom have gone on to more senior positions within their universities. It&#x2019;s funded and supported by Universities New Zealand vice-chancellors. As well as an annual leadership programme for university women, NZWiL has developed discipline-based programmes and later this year will focus on engineering, computer science, information systems, agriculture and horticulture, where women have traditionally struggled to get to the top.","University of Waikato Professor of Law Margaret Wilson will this year receive a NZWiL excellence award for her work on gender equality in the tertiary sector. She has fought for the rights of women in politics, law and, most specifically, the university sector all her life.

It&#x2019;s also a sector enjoying strong growth, with year to date enrolment figures at 31 August 2017 showing that 106,021 international students had enrolled to study.","New Zealand Private Training Establishments (PTEs) are one group of New Zealand education providers creating flexible course options for thousands of students each year, but recent enforcement of strict guidelines by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority have made a clear impact on the way that these providers operate.","This shift has benefited the education industry overall, by moving it towards the provision of quality rather than quantity when it comes to courses, but has forced many PTE providers to look at how they can innovate and automate through the wider adoption of technology.","<strong>Automating recruitment processes</strong>","Smaller colleges and training establishments can struggle with the burden of international recruitment and administration, often having smaller teams. This means keeping track of tasks and contacts, and processing global payments such as agent commissions or student refunds gets complicated when doing so across different currency types. Errors can happen and they&#x2019;re hard to fix.","By moving from paper based systems to digital platforms, providers can automate many of their processes, reducing errors and saving valuable time on administrative tasks.","<strong>Streamlined online experience</strong>","It&#x2019;s critical for PTEs to have a high quality website which enables a streamlined, straight forward online application process for international students and agents. Many students struggle with the application process when applying to study overseas. From having to deal with a language barrier, to complicated systems and multiple application processes across providers and government agencies; anything that PTEs can do to make the process easier will afford these providers a more competitive advantage.","Artificial intelligence offered by online platforms can also play a role in this domain, by analysing and answering routine queries, and supporting multilingual communication. Most PTEs won&#x2019;t have the ability to cover every language themselves, so intelligent bots that can translate on the fly can make for an important bridge.","<strong>Centralised payment hubs</strong>","Making cross-border payments can be a tricky enough issue for companies, let alone individuals. From problems getting funds into New Zealand, to the cost of transferring them out of the country mean that international payments are expensive, opaque and slow, with money often getting lost along the way.","Many families may have saved for years and pooled funds to enable a student to study overseas. It&#x2019;s important for them to get as much for their money as possible without it being swallowed up in bank fees or poor exchange rates. When they arrive, most international students don&#x2019;t have New Zealand bank accounts which are vital for day-to-day money needs. Managing money can be a great stress, on top of being in unfamiliar surroundings, far from family and their usual support networks.","PTEs who move to a centralised, online system for international payments are more able to provide international students with a better overseas study experience, saving them time and money. Having everything in one place makes it much easier and simpler for transactions, and gives providers a clear picture of their unique student set and payment types.","The New Zealand government is strongly supporting its international education market as a key driver of the economy, with the International Education Strategy 2018-2030 aiming to &#x201C;create an environment where international education can thrive and provide economic, social and cultural benefits for all New Zealand&#x201D;. PTEs are an integral part of this sector. While they may face certain challenges compared to larger universities, due to operating on much smaller margins and short timeframes, the organisations who are excelling are those who think outside the box. Embracing technology, and making life easier for international students and agents to communicate and transact online will deliver exciting benefits as the sector continues its rapid expansion.","<strong><em>Guy St Clair is New Zealand General Manager at </em></strong><a href=\"https://cohortgo.com/\"><strong><em>Cohort Go</em></strong></a><strong><em> where he is responsible for driving and supporting the company&#x2019;s growth across New Zealand&#x2019;s international education market.</em></strong>"],"source":{"name":null,"href":null},"tags":["international students","Private Training Establishments","PTEs","recruitment","technology"]},{"category":"opinion","title":"Response: Teacher Education Refresh programme is working","subtitle":"The Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand (formerly Education Council) responds to criticism of the Teacher Education Refresh programme.","author":"Education Central","date":"October 3, 2018","content":["In response to&#xA0;Education Review&#x2019;s&#xA0;article <a href=\"http://educationreview.co.nz/why-overseas-teachers-will-help-but-not-solve-new-zealands-teacher-shortage-crisis/\">Why overseas teachers will help but not solve New Zealand&#x2019;s teacher shortage crisis</a>.","The Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand has increased the number of staff who process overseas teacher applications. However, our role remains ensuring quality teachers are in front of learners.","The Teacher Education Refresh (TER) programme was designed to support New Zealand registered teachers, who no longer meet the current statutory requirements, renew their provisional practising certificate and continue to be employed as teachers (teachers who have not taught for six years or who have been unable to meet full certification requirements after six years).","The article refers to anecdotal evidence that suggests many returning or overseas teachers are finding it difficult to get registered or employed in New Zealand. The Council has reviewed its processes and ensured that we can assess an application quickly for those teachers who provide required information.","Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand numbers reveal that almost 800 overseas teachers have been registered so far this year. In the eight months to 31 August 2018, the Council received 988 applications from overseas trained teachers to register in New Zealand. Of these 796 applicants received their registration to teach in New Zealand schools. Just 36 applications were declined for not having the necessary qualifications.","In addition to the 800 overseas teachers, a total of 1129 New Zealand trained teachers have successfully completed the TER programme since July 2015. Currently 400 New Zealand teachers are enrolled in the programme. This means that 1129 teachers (with another 400 to follow) have been returned to the profession. In other words, 1500 teachers who were unable to meet the statutory requirements to renew their practising certificates now have, or will soon have, provisional certification and legally be able to work in centres or schools. This is the benefit of TER.","It is also now free for New Zealand and overseas trained teachers to enrol in the TER programme, following the Government&#x2019;s 2018 budget announcement that it would fund the cost of TER enrolment for the next four years.","The curriculum content of the TER programme is contained in four modules.

I failed maths and chemistry.&#x201D;","It wasn&#x2019;t until university &#x2013; where he studied neuroscience &#x2013; that he began to understand that it is <em>how</em> you study and the tools you use that have the greatest bearing on learning outcomes and engagement.","So, with friend Hamish Parbhu, Kumar has set out to change that for today&#x2019;s high school students with the creation of QuickSense, a personalised learning tool that ultimately aims to change the way students study.","QuickSense works a bit like this: a student logs in and is provided with questions or problems to solve. Based on how well they answer the questions, QuickSense can gauge where the student&#x2019;s strengths and weaknesses lie. For concepts the student hasn&#x2019;t grasped well yet, the questions will continue at an easier level, but more frequently. For concepts the student is mastering, the questions become more contextualised and based on real-world application. Each student has their own personalised set of questions that are specifically tailored for them.","Meanwhile teachers can see where the individual and collective strengths and weaknesses lie in their classes. Teachers can also see where and why students have made mistakes. Students are given a chance to explain where they think they went wrong and teachers can help drill down into their working.","While QuickSense is aligned with <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em>, its main focus is not so much about teaching to the NCEA exam at the end of the year but more about making learning relevant to various contexts and real-world applications. By taking this approach, better NCEA results&#xA0;typically follow anyway.","&#x201C;QuickSense is flexible enough that it can help students get from &#x2018;Not Achieved&#x2019; all the way to &#x2018;Excellent&#x2019;,&#x201D; says Kumar, &#x201C;At the same time, it&#x2019;s not necessarily about achievement standards but rather about giving students an understanding that their education can be applied to everything in their life.&#x201D;","Research shows that students typically achieve better results when learning is personalised. The duo did their homework before embarking on their new venture.","&#x201C;On average personalised learning helps improve a student&#x2019;s grades by 22 per cent,&#x201D; says Kumar. &#x201C;While this doesn&#x2019;t translate exactly to NCEA, it just shows the power of how designing education around the student can really help the student&#x2019;s learning and engagement.&#x201D;","He&#x2019;s right. There are many examples strewn across New Zealand and overseas to support the case for individualised learning. But the challenge has always been how to make this a reality in a class of kids at all different levels.","&#x201C;In a classroom a teacher often has to teach to the average &#x2013; it&#x2019;s hard to cater for students&#x2019; differing levels of progress. There&#x2019;s not enough flexibility in the classroom for the teacher to say, I&#x2019;m going to create content that&#x2019;s going to challenge you no matter what level you&#x2019;re at&#x2019;.&#x201D;","QuickSense aims to provide a solution for teachers. It is currently operational in STEM-based subjects, but they are looking at rolling out to commerce subjects and eventually to the arts &#x2013; although they are mindful that a different approach might need to be taken for these subjects.","The timing for the launch of a tool like this is spot-on. The NCEA Review is showing all the signs of moving away from &#x2018;teaching to the test&#x2019; and more towards contextualised and individualised project-based learning. QuickSense plays perfectly into this sort of approach.","&#x201C;With the NCEA Review coming up, we know that exams are going to change in some form or another, but what you learn is largely going to remain the same so what we&#x2019;re trying to place the emphasis on not studying for the test, but rather for the context,&#x201D; says Kumar.","They&#x2019;re looking at developing this concept further with a feature called Learning Paths, which allows students to tailor their learning to particular courses, problems or vocations.","For now though, their immediate focus is on getting the nitty gritty right to suit the needs of teachers and students. It appears they&#x2019;re doing something right, owing to the positive feedback they&#x2019;re hearing from schools.","They&#x2019;re currently working with 22 secondary schools, mainly in Auckland, and more recently in Hamilton. They&#x2019;ve had some interest from Wellington schools, too. Macleans College, Green Bay High School, Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate, Epsom Girls&#x2019; Grammar and Hamilton Girls&#x2019; High School are among those to experience QuickSense so far. They hope to work with over 100 schools by next year.","&#x201C;Students love it,&#x201D; says Kumar, &#x201C;It makes it easier to study as well. Right now [study] feels more like a chore than something we care about.&#x201D;","Epsom Girls&#x2019; Grammar teacher Eujine Kim says she is using QuickSense as a &#x201C;do now&#x201D; for her students.","&#x201C;My students like it because it helps them remember what we covered before &#x2013; it&#x2019;s great for retention.","&#x201C;I also like minimal input from teachers to run it &#x2013; we are overloaded as it is! Once we put our course timeline in, then that&#x2019;s it. I monitor students&#x2019; progress every day and I am planning to have short tutoring sessions soon.","&#x201C;There are a few changes or improvements I hope to see but I think it is a great start.

This model creates a considerable rethink regarding our understanding of the notion of intelligence. This emerging model includes:","Before educators can embark on new pedagogies of practice that are consistent with 21<sup>st</sup>-century demands, we need improved clarity as to how the brain learns and remembers.","In this emerging model, the human brain starts out life with about 70-80% of its cells being neurons. That percentage appears to drop over our first 25 years of life to less than 30%, with the most significant reduction in neurons happening between the ages of 8-12 years old. The brain then continues to reduce the number of neurons through our lives.","Why is that, and what are the implications for the learning that can be achieved at different ages? Over the past 16 years, we have built on the work of numerous neuroscience leaders to create a model for &#x2018;how the brain learns.&#x2019; The breakthrough came in realising the brain has an integrated set of 4+1 learning systems rather than a single learning system. These learning systems seem to have evolved over different time periods, resulting in each one having different roles, with different efficiencies and capabilities. However, each of the four systems appears to communicate with each other giving us an integrated learning process.","The chronology of our acquisition of each learning system is outlined below:","A summary of the time frames and the efficiencies of each learning system are below:","* An optimistic &#x2018;average&#x2019; with a number of exceptions","As humans have evolved, each successive learning system has become more sophisticated. Our most inefficient and inequitable learning system is learning via rote. Remembering &#x2018;off by heart&#x2019; or via rote is something humans have always done, as it was our first learning system, but this first learning system was very inefficient and inequitable. Over millennia, rote learning has become a minor player when compared to our other learning systems, until everyone had to learn to read and write. Our rote learning process is the learning system that contributes most significantly to the creation of the standard distribution curve of success in learning within schools, as each of the other learning systems appears remarkably equitable.","We need to re-look at what neuroscience tells us about brain function and how we can leverage this to craft a set of teaching and learning capacities that focus on:","We have built on the work of numerous neuroscience researchers/leaders to create a model for &#x2018;how the brain learns&#x2019;, over the past 16-years. The breakthrough came in realising the brain has an integrated set of 4+1 learning systems rather than a single learning system.","Learning is a complex process, but a great example of the efficiency and equity of the <strong>conceptual</strong> learning process when learning to drive a car. Learning to drive is an extraordinarily complex learning process, but it is <a href=\"https://www.admiral.com/men-v-women-learners\">achieved equitably by almost everyone</a>, with minimal variance in learner success.","This learning process is equitable because the &#x2018;uninformed&#x2019; parent/caregiver puts the learner in the driver&#x2019;s seat and provides them with the minimum knowledge (rote learning) &#x2013; &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the brake, and that is the accelerator; don&#x2019;t get that wrong! Right, let&#x2019;s go!&#x201D; The learner driver then adapts the differential pressures of their feet on the two pedals to get the car moving.","After five to seven starts at applying this differential calculus problem, the learner driver learns the pressure variations that enable them to take-off smoothly. The brain maps that concept (pattern) and automates it into a non-conscious process. The parent then moves to the next concept of slowing down evenly to arrive at a specific point (more algebra).","Within 40 hours the learner driver has mapped and automated numerous concepts (patterns) and is driving solo! The key here is to keep the rote-learned knowledge to a minimum and work through the concepts sequentially to create a conceptual framework for driving any car.","If we compare learning to drive with learning to read and write, we quickly realise that there are no conceptual underpinnings (patterns) to the sounds or letters, their shapes and the spelling of words! These all have to be learned via rote (our most inefficient learning system). A host of other aspects of learning to read and write are also pattern-less, and as a result, also have to be learned by rote. This also applies to the numerous rules of syntax and the sequencing of words.","As a result, for the majority of the first two years of learning to read and write, there are no patterns for the brain to map and generalise that would allow the learner to predict how words should be spelt. Reading and writing are used in schools to differentiate learners &#x2018;intelligence.&#x2019; In this model, there is a belief that this difference in capability to remember via rote is genetic, based on how many generations the learner has behind them where the process of rote learning was involved.","If we let learners gather information by watching videos (viewing and sequencing), rather than reading the book (initially based on rote-learning), the distribution curve of success becomes far more equitable. Generally speaking, educators do not greet these suggestions with enthusiasm, and this is not surprising, as we have a very guarded history of reading and writing &#x2026; but if we want equity in learning, there may need to be some sacrificing of a few of our &#x2018;sacred cows.&#x2019;","The question remains then; are we willing to change our practices in how learners access the information that they require. Everyone is increasingly obtaining the information we need via YouTube because it is more efficient than having to read and write. I would suggest this debate will be hotly debated; as it should, but not at the expense of our learner&#x2019;s ability to access information, after all, we have only been &#x2018;doing reading and writing for the masses&#x2019; for 2-3 centuries.","We have distilled three 400pp literature reviews into a single readable and free volume: &#x2018;The Future of Learning&#x2019; (230pp) <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2JZAGcp\">http://bit.ly/2JZAGcp</a>.

So, whilst completing her Graduate Diploma in Teaching she attended the 2017 Primary Teaching Recruitment Expo.","&#x201C;I had originally studied education for two years at university before going down the commerce route. Teaching was something I always wanted to do as I believe every child deserves a great education,&#x201D; Vanessa says.","&#x201C;I had a clear idea of which schools I was interested in working with,&#x201D; Vanessa says. &#x201C;The event itself was a great opportunity to have an informal chat with the principals and staff from the schools, which gave me a better understanding of their culture and teaching philosophies.&#x201D;","&#x201C;By speaking to staff, I got a sense of what it would be like to be a beginning teacher there, which is something you might not be able to get from their website or in a more formal interview setting.&#x201D;","Vanessa&#xA0;received offers of employment from both the schools she set out to meet at the expo, eventually accepting an offer from Remuera Primary School, where her daughter now attends as a student.","Since starting as a beginning teacher, she says her career has been &#x201C;an incredible ride&#x201D;.","&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t deny that it&#x2019;s tough, some days more so than others, but the rewards far outweigh the challenges. I am incredibly lucky to work at a really supportive school and have the best mentor &#x2013; I think both those things could make or break you as a beginning teacher.&#x201D;","Principal of Remuera Primary School and Treasurer of the APPA Steve King says the Recruitment Expo was conceived of as a way for schools to reach out to recent graduates.","&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve worked internationally where recruitment fairs are more common, so it was interesting to see how well it worked here. I think one of the most exciting things about it was the way it turned the recruitment process on its head. I had a number of really exciting conversations with applicants and it wasn&#x2019;t until the next day that I actually looked at CVs, so I got a sense of who they were before that.&#x201D;","He says one of the reasons he was immediately drawn to Vanessa as an applicant was that she showcased herself well, giving him a sense that she was joining the profession for the right reasons.","&#x201C;I liked the fact that she was well-travelled and was coming to teaching from another career that she had been successful at. She was clearly bringing a lot of life experience and we were really excited that she accepted our offer. We&#x2019;ve been really thrilled at how she can reflect on her own practice and identify what her strengths are in progressing her career.&#x201D;","This year&#x2019;s event is expected to see roughly 40 schools have a presence and there&#x2019;s pressure for schools to put their best foot forward, so Remuera Primary School will be bringing Vanessa along as part of their stall this year.","&#x201C;Last year was really successful, which has brought more schools this year,&#x201D; Mr King says. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s great but it means there&#x2019;s a bit of friendly competition between schools and with the teacher shortage graduates know they hold the cards, so we&#x2019;ve got to go the extra mile marketing ourselves on the day. Having someone there who has been through the process recently is a great way of authentically communicating what being a beginning teacher at Remuera Primary School is like.&#x201D;","<strong><u>Vanessa&#x2019;s top tips for those going to the Primary Teacher Recruitment Expo in 2018:</u></strong>","Auckland Primary Teaching Recruitment Expo is for new and returning teachers who are looking to start working in primary and intermediate schools in Auckland at the start of Term One in 2019.

We could offer a prize because that always gets people into it,&#x201D; adds another.","&#x201C;But make sure the activity still makes them look cool.&#x201D;","And next, a subtle breakthrough in thinking:","&#x201C;Yeah, so it sticks to the norm of cool but changes the expectations of what that is.&#x201D;","We&#x2019;re at a conference for SADD or Students Against Dangerous Driving. With chapters in secondary schools around the country since the 1980s, SADD is a national institution. The aim for this year&#x2019;s conference participants: learning a process of design thinking that empowers them to be change agents in their school community.","The students do so through a team challenge in which they design initiatives to take back to school to promote safe road use. The design thinking challenge, including supporting videos, was created by the NZ Transport Agency. Each video shows design thinking in action, as the Transport Agency&#x2019;s education and advertising team discuss how they create national road safety campaigns.","Leigh Mitchell, Director of Customer Experience and Behaviour, says the Transport Agency and SADD share a common goal of keeping young people safe on the road.","&#x201C;The main super-power that SADD brings to the party is peer-to-peer influencing, which is one of the most powerful ways of changing behaviour,&#x201D; she says.","Design thinking boosts this capability. It&#x2019;s about creating effective solutions to problems faced by real people. In educational settings, it gives students a practical pathway to respond to authentic contexts. The design thinking steps in use at the SADD conference are:","The next stage beyond this is for the students to take their ideas back to school and test them out with real people. Further refinements can follow.","Charlotte Dey from Otumoetai College is a national SADD student leader and says design thinking is a positive process.","&#x201C;It&#x2019;s interesting to see how the design process works,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;You come up with these ideas and you&#x2019;ve got to analyse every aspect of it to see that it works, to make sure it can actually be used in your communities and your schools.&#x201D;","<strong>Design thinking in action</strong>","At conference, Charlotte&#x2019;s team looks at the issue of speed. They&#x2019;ve read through a Transport Agency dataset which shows drivers under 25 are over-represented in speed-related crashes. The team debates if their target audience is male or female or both.","&#x201C;I think you don&#x2019;t want to separate genders, both need help, but more data specific to each gender would be helpful,&#x201D; says one member.","&#x201C;Males and females have the same problems in the speed stats, but different causes,&#x201D; says another.","&#x201C;Do we have evidence of different causes?&#x201D;","There&#x2019;s more talk, some banter about residual plots and then Mason Potich, Bream Bay College, grabs a whiteboard marker and they record their thinking about what motivates young drivers, male and female.","&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve got to focus on who you&#x2019;re targeting, so our target audience is people our age, which is probably the best thing about this being student-led. We can relate to what&#x2019;s going on,&#x201D; Mason says later.","Another team moves to the prototype stage. They settle on a game that helps players think about driving to the conditions. Equipment needed: two tarpaulins, dishwashing liquid, tennis balls, torches and water guns. The game will involve decision making, running around lots, and getting wet.","&#x201C;The aim is to show you always need to adapt to different road conditions and that the shortest way is not always the safest,&#x201D; says a team member.","A third team is responding to the topic of distracted drivers. They&#x2019;ve focused on one type of distraction &#x2014; road rage &#x2014; which appears in their dataset about young drivers. Their idea is to share strategies for dealing with other drivers&#x2019; behaviour, so their generation is better-equipped to manage their reactions.","Team member Bailey says that in the ideation phase, they planned on creating an app.","&#x201C;But an app would need funding. So, we&#x2019;re using Instagram as an existing platform rather than starting with a fresh slate.&#x201D;","Bailey and Piper run through a mock-up on a whiteboard. Images on the Instagram feed would highlight road use behaviours that make people angry. Each post includes a link to the SADD website where advice can be housed, and there&#x2019;s scope for moderated comments to be posted.","<strong>Ecosystem of support</strong>","SADD National Manager Donna Govorko says the design thinking exercise focuses student enthusiasm for creating activities.","&#x201C;It leads them through a step-by-step problem-solving approach which analyses the issues and encourages them to put thought into who they are targeting and the message they want to convey to get the desired outcome.&#x201D;","Operations Manager Victoria Domigan says the team challenge has ongoing benefit, leading to ideas and activities created by students that are aligned with best practice, relevant to young people and focussed on current road safety issues.","&#x201C;We also now have a cohort of students running SADD in their schools who have an in-depth understanding of the different factors that should be considered when planning road safety education in their schools, rather than just picking an activity to run because it sounds fun without giving thought to their audience or the specific road safety issues in their community.&#x201D;","Victoria says the process puts the students in the driver&#x2019;s seat and encourage them to collaborate with local road safety experts.","Indeed, conferences are just part of the support for SADD members. Most chapters have a support teacher, providing an ongoing connection between the school and SADD&#x2019;s national support staff such as delivery leads Katherine Blake and Alex Drummond, who visit schools.","Police officers are also in the mix &#x2014; with the Auckland conference attended by officers who specialise in working with schools or in the field of road safety.","<strong>Support at school: a teacher&#x2019;s view</strong>","Rotorua Lakes High School SADD support teacher Jenny Hartigan says the design thinking process used at conference looks excellent.","&#x201C;Thinking, designing and reflecting are integral processes for producing a quality product.&#xA0;We&#x2019;ve used the SADD principles to design some of our road safety activities, but we certainly could do with more thinking, designing and reflecting to come up with effective activities in the future.&#x201D;","Jenny says she helps organise student meetings and passes on information from SADD staff, but it is Rotorua Lakes students who take the lead on organising each term&#x2019;s activities.","&#x201C;They come up with some really creative ideas themselves. Plus, it&#x2019;s teaching them leadership skills, responsibility, and how to manage themselves.","&#x201C;I&#x2019;m just there as to guide them. I&#x2019;ve been doing this the last eight years. I enjoy it and I&#x2019;ve built good relationships with the students who are in it. It&#x2019;s a cause I feel strongly about, especially as far as teenagers are concerned.&#x201D;","<strong>Conference a starting point for social action</strong>","Donna Govorko says the team challenges fit with SADD&#x2019;s overall mission.","&#x201C;SADD is about empowering young people and building young citizens, kids who care about their community. Being safe on the roads is a big component of their lives.&#x201D;","Charlotte Dey says she is looking forward to running the newly designed activities in her school.","&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll see for myself how well they work, where we went wrong and what went well&#x2026; and aim to make a positive impact back home.&#x201D;","Anton Haines of&#xA0;De La Salle College says the team challenge has prompted more thinking from his team.","&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve got to think about what you&#x2019;re aiming at, the people you&#x2019;re aiming it to, if it&#x2019;s interactive for our generation.

","author":"Education Central","date":"September 24, 2018","content":["While Hobsonville Point Secondary School (HPSS) was being built, ready for opening in 2014, a group of leaders designed its curriculum. Beginning with a blank canvas, they devised a learning design model suitable for 21<sup>st</sup> century students and aiming to produce critical thinkers and empowered, life-long learners.","For its first four years, Dr Noeline Wright from the University of Waikato&#x2019;s Wilf Malcolm Institute of Educational Research monitored progress and the results of her observations are now in a book, <em>Becoming an Innovative Learning Environment:&#xA0;The Making of a New Zealand Secondary&#xA0;School.</em>","Through its school leaders, Dr Wright was granted access to all areas of the school, including other staff, foundation students and their parents. &#x201C;They gave me carte blanche to everything and everybody. That was a privilege. They were open and transparent,&#x201D; she says.","&#x201C;The school aimed to provide future-oriented education, replacing hierarchical teaching models with technology-enabled social learning practices and a cohesive learning model supporting self-discovery. One aim was to be more inclusive so students would learn with and from each other,&#x201D; says Dr Wright.","HPSS and the nearby primary school share a single Board of Trustees, operating under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement where a private company manages the plant of the two schools. Initially, the principal Maurie Abraham was apprehensive about a PPP arrangement. A PPP school he had visited in Liverpool in the UK didn&#x2019;t impress him, because the property owners imposed restrictions that would have impeded school activities if applied in a New Zealand context.","One structure fundamental to the fabric of HPSS is the Learning Design Model (LDM). &#x201C;I think it was a genius piece of work,&#x201D; says Dr Wright. &#x201C;The verbs of the model, such as test, generate, explore, can apply in different combinations to all learning and assessment. So regardless of subject combinations in modules, all teachers used LDM verbs to identify the key foci for the lesson.","A module might combine PE and maths. Initially, connections may not be obvious. When students learn and use statistics to interpret, for example, heath statistics, then they see the application of mathematics to authentic contexts. Linking these subjects are the verbs of the LDM.","&#x201C;I was impressed how articulately students could describe how things worked for them. Even randomly approached students in classrooms could explain things confidently. I can&#x2019;t say that about all classrooms in all schools I have been in.&#x201D;","Dr Wright says student opinion is valued and has influenced the structures that teachers work with. Parents are consulted and invited to meet the principal informally, such as at a &#x2018;Morning Tea with Maurie&#x2019;.","Mr Abraham says a key principle in decision-making at HPSS has been on <em>Powerful Partnerships.</em> &#x201C;We have been determined to invite students into the process of designing learning and to invite parents to be active participants alongside us,&#x201D; he says.","Equally important with academic learning is pastoral care through the Learning Hub. Dispositional behaviours called &#x2018;Hobsonville Habits&#x2019; link to the academic and pastoral process.","The Habits align with the school&#x2019;s understanding of whole-brain development and focus on aspects such as cognitive, relational, critical and creative aspects of learning.","Within the Hubs, every student has a learning coach, who is responsible for about 15 students throughout their secondary school careers. About four hours a week are timetabled for Hub time to address learning and social issues or needs. Teachers have access to their students&#x2019; digital folders, and parents have ready access to the principal and teachers.","&#x201C;The students noted that the boundaries between teacher and student sometimes appear blurred,&#x201D; says Dr Wright. &#x201C;While teachers are addressed by their first name, students know their work is easily checked. Students don&#x2019;t seem to mind this scrutiny; they see it as part of the pastoral care process.&#x201D;","Her book about the school discusses key ideas through metaphors, from &#xA0;a &#x2019;Paradigm of One&#x2019; through to a &#x2018;Paradigm of the Many&#x2019; about the wider community being involved in outcomes. For example, school leaders have based a small group of start-up companies, called Pollinators, on site. Staff from these companies work with students as they develop their own projects and Dr Wright says this collaboration works for the students and the companies. &#x201C;The Pollinators love being in the school, they find it rewarding to work with the students to support them through project and product design.&#x201D;","Dr Wright says the school and board were brave and visionary. &#x201C;They knew that their innovations would create waves, which is why they spent a lot of time with parents. At the parent morning teas, Maurie explains and responds to questions about the emphasis on pastoral care and the individual student focus. That attracted some families and put others off. Parents I spoke to at one of the morning teas said that their children, who had learning difficulties, couldn&#x2019;t wait to come to school every day. It indicates that the pastoral care orientation of Learning Coaches and the way the learning is organised, is working.&#x201D;","HPSS has dispensed with Level 1 NCEA, as have some other New Zealand schools. Instead, students spend two years working towards Level 2 to obtain higher quality NCEA credits. This gives them more time to think and learn deeply without high anxiety and stress, says Dr Wright.","She says the system isn&#x2019;t perfect; they make changes as they go along. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s about risk taking, and instead of talking about failure they talk about learning something they didn&#x2019;t know before use that experience to influence their next decisions.&#x201D;","Mr Abraham says they&#x2019;re in a continuous state of learning, and he&#x2019;s pleased with the way the school has taken shape. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve set out to focus on our students being engaged in deep learning, and on putting the needs of the learners at the centre of all of our decision-making, with a particular focus on student wellbeing.

That is going to change with our rebuild,&#x201D; she said.","Westlake Boys High School headmaster David Ferguson said the North Shore already represented a network of schools where families could choose single-sex, co-ed, integrated or private schools.","Auckland Grammar School principal Tim O&#x2019;Connor said the current model worked well for 15 out of 16 schools, noting that the paper found that one of every 16 schools had been subjected to a government intervention in the past three years.","&#x201C;If 15 out of 16 schools are operating well under a Tomorrow&#x2019;s Schools model, you would see that as a highly successful model, wouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; he said.","But nationally, families have used school choice to choose higher-decile schools.","Across the country, the rolls of schools in the poorest 30 per cent of neighbourhoods have dropped from 187,379 in 1996 to 179,559 last year, while the rolls in the richest three deciles have ballooned from 199,341 to 296,650.","Pakuranga College principal Mike Williams, who leads the Secondary Principals&#x2019; Association, said both the former National Government, with its &#x201C;communities of learning&#x201D;, and the current Labour-led Government wanted schools to compete less and co-operate more.","&#x201C;The gap is widening between the haves and the have-nots, so something does need to change,&#x201D; he said.","&#x201C;Obviously competition is one of the key things they are looking at. But hand in hand with that is parental choice, which is fundamental.","&#x201C;I think if there was no parental choice at all, there would be a big backlash from the community.&#x201D;","<strong>Auckland&#x2019;s out-of-zone top 10</strong>","Out-of-zoners&#x2019; per cent of roll","1.Auckland Girls Grammar 83.5%<br>\n2.Avondale College 62.4%<br>\n3.Edgewater College 56.7%<br>\n4.Onehunga High 52.7%<br>\n5.Westlake Girls High 51.3%<br>\n6.Westlake Boys High 50.8%<br>\n7.Rangitoto College 49.1%<br>\n8.Mt Roskill Grammar 42.7%<br>\n9.Selwyn College 40.3%<br>\n10.Albany Senior High 39.9%","Source: Ministry of Education data for March 2018","<em><strong>Source: <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12126252\">NZ Herald</a></strong></em>"],"source":{"name":"NZ Herald","href":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12126252"},"tags":["Auckland","enrolments","funding","home zones","out-of-zone","zoning"]},{"category":"sectors","title":"Chris Hipkins announces takeover of Whitireia and WelTec","subtitle":"Chris Hipkins said Whitireia would have had to close its doors this month without a cash injection from the government.

A one-off session at the beginning of the year does not work.","Effective systems and processes around NCEA and UE are essential &#x2013; particularly data utilisation, achievement tracking and academic mentoring.","Students need multiple opportunities to learn and achieve &#x2013; that is, extra tutoring, additional opportunities for re-assessment, further catch up assistance when work was missed, and additional opportunities to experience exam-style assessments. NCEA is premised on &#x201C;being flexible&#x201D; but it isn&#x2019;t in reality, it is school timetable-centric and subject to the time restraints of teachers.","Tracking and monitoring Year 9 and 10 students for UE is important &#x2013; particularly in literacy. Perhaps a cross-subject inquiry project &#x2013; with a strong literacy and numeracy focus &#x2013; could actually begin in Year 9 and 10. Research has repeatedly shown that it is in Y9-10 that our M&amp;P students need the most wraparound help with understanding how to craft their writing (literacy) and make associations between their mathematical skills and solving real life problems (numeracy).","There was a consistent theme in the data about the low expectations teachers hold for both M&amp;P students and their wh&#x101;nau.","<strong><em>EC: Do you think our current NCEA system is suited to the needs of M&#x101;ori and Pacific students? Why or why not?</em></strong>","<strong>MW: </strong>Many teachers do not know the academic or post-secondary school aspirations of their M&#x101;ori and Pasifika students and their whanau. This is critical to M&amp;P disengagement from learning. We need better 1:1 academic mentoring based on students long term academic goals, and sound data utilisation, tracking and monitoring &#x2013; with UE as the ultimate goal.","<strong><em>EC: In 2017 you were awarded a Rutherford Discovery Fellowship to tackle an important question facing educators: &#x2018;How can we foster cultural pride and academic aspiration among M&#x101;ori students?&#x2019; Based on your research, what could we do better or differently?</em></strong>","<strong>MW:</strong> Ensure schools have curriculum that recognises and celebrates M&#x101;ori knowledge &#x2013; particularly with regard to science and technology. We also need better resources celebrating M&#x101;ori role models (living or dead) who have been exceptional and successful &#x2013; our children do not currently see people like them celebrated in the school context.","<strong><em>EC: One of the Six Big Opportunities of the NCEA Review focuses on dismantling barriers to NCEA. In your opinion, what is currently the biggest barrier to NCEA for secondary students?</em></strong>","<strong>MW:</strong> A lack of academic mentoring &#x2013; tailored to their specific goals and aspirations. It doesn&#x2019;t matter what qualification system you put in place &#x2013; if you don&#x2019;t arm students and their families with the skills and knowledge to navigate it, they are unlikely to thrive. We must design academic advising systems that are less teacher-centric and more student-centric. We must also teach ALL teachers how to utilise data more effectively in their practice. We also need a better, and perhaps a nation-wide, single student management system.","<strong><em>EC: &#xA0;As a panellist for our first Chalk Talk, what do you hope emerges from the discussions around NCEA and our qualifications system? </em></strong>","<strong>MW:</strong> I hope the audience and participants come away with the idea that they cannot design a new system, or refine the old one, without working alongside M&amp;P students and whanau to do so &#x2013; particularly those whanau and students who attend kura M&#x101;ori, or rural, isolated, hard-to-staff schools.

NZ universities are also dropping in<a href=\"https://educationcentral.co.nz/staff-cuts-drag-nz-universities-down-in-world-rankings-but-waikato-university-jumps/\">&#xA0;the rival QS rankings</a>&#xA0;but two are still in QS&#x2019;s top 200 &#x2013; Auckland at 85th and Otago at 175th.","Both systems are based partly on large surveys asking academics about which universities have the strongest reputations for teaching and research.","The Times survey gives a heavier weight (30 per cent) than QS (20 per cent) to citations &#x2013; the number of times a paper is referenced in other papers in academic journals.","Both organisations are London-based and both their academic surveys and the journals they search are biased towards English-language countries. The Times&#x2019; top 200 include 60 universities in the United States and 30 in Britain, but none in Latin America or India and only one (Cape Town) in Africa.","The University of Auckland&#x2019;s decline this year was due to lower scores for teaching reputation and research income from industry, although it was still ranked ahead of all other NZ universities on both factors.","Auckland and Otago are both now ranked in a band between 201st and 250th in the world &#x2013; a place which Auckland&#x2019;s deputy vice-chancellor John Morrow said was more damaging than last year&#x2019;s slide from 165th to 192nd.","&#x201C;We could be anywhere from 201 to 249. It&#x2019;s more damaging reputationally to be in that vague zone,&#x201D; he said.","However AUT (formerly Auckland University of Technology) and Canterbury University both improved their rankings. AUT climbed from between 401st and 500th last year to between 301st and 350th, and Canterbury improved from between 351st and 400th to between 301st and 350th.","AUT vice-chancellor Derek McCormack said AUT gained the highest NZ ratings for citations and for &#x201C;international outlook&#x201D;, a category based on the proportions of international students, staff and internationally co-authored papers.","A sixth (17 per cent) of AUT&#x2019;s equivalent fulltime students, and 47 per cent of its academic staff, are from overseas.","McCormack said AUT&#x2019;s high citation rate reflected its large health and sports science faculty, which &#x201C;tends to be more highly cited&#x201D;.","&#x201C;A higher percentage of our research is in that field, and we have a smaller amount of research overall, so we have the advantage of that weighting,&#x201D; he said.","Morrow said all NZ universities received much less funding per student than their counterparts in Australia and elsewhere. He said the Government&#x2019;s decision to spend $550 million fees-free tuition for first-year students added nothing to the universities&#x2019; income.","But Acting Education Minister Tracey Martin said the fees-free policy &#x201C;has absolutely achieved its objective to reduce the cost burden of tertiary education on students&#x201D;.","&#x201C;This Government is providing the biggest across the board increase of 1.6 per cent to tuition subsidies for universities in more than five years,&#x201D; she said. The increase will take effect from next January.","National Party tertiary education spokeswoman Paula Bennett said the fees-free policy was &#x201C;nothing but an expensive bribe which has had no impact on encouraging more students into tertiary education&#x201D;.","&#x201C;It&#x2019;s time the Government admitted that this is a $2.8 billion failure which has meant there&#x2019;s no funding available to increase resourcing and improve the quality of our universities,&#x201D;

Now Director of the Melbourne Education Research Institute, Hattie has concluded there are actually more differences between the performance of similar children within a school than between different schools.","<strong>Do your research</strong>","Both Williams and Hattie advise visiting the school to do your own research. Any good school will have an open day or evening, with teachers and students being present.<br>\nAlso, what do you find when you look up the &#x2018;Rate my Teachers&#x2019; website?","You may find schooling has changed a lot since late last century: there may be a broader range of subjects available, including philosophy and photography, as well as other subjects to support post-school technical qualifications.","Williams says many problems are now solved in groups, reflecting the modern workplace.<br>\n&#x201C;For most employers today, the lone wolf is a liability,&#x201D; he says.","Hattie, who has four grown-up children, has prepared some advice for discerning parents, including asking if you can sit in on a lesson.","Some of his advice may surprise you as it is quite different from what so many parents focus on. The main premise is that good teaching is the key &#x2013; so it&#x2019;s what the principal does to make good teachers better that matters. He also advises finding out whether teachers collaborate within the school &#x2013; the idea being that teachers get better by working together.","<strong>Open days</strong>","On an open day, Hattie says, &#x201C;Focus on the school&#x2019;s attitude to teachers and teaching.&#x201D;<br>\nDoes the school have &#x2018;open doors&#x2019; so other teachers can offer them feedback on their work?","&#x201C;Do teachers observe one another&#x2019;s teaching and give each other constructive feedback?&#x201D;<br>\nAssessment is an idea Hattie turns on its head. The idea behind it is not to &#x2018;judge&#x2019; but to provide feedback to the teacher&#x2013; so that they can adjust their teaching to suit.","Hattie says schools should also learn from each other, as is actually practised in many New Zealand schools. The question to ask, he says, is &#x201C;How much professional development is available to teachers?&#x201D;","There are also cultural differences between some of the grammar schools, other state schools and integrated Catholic and fully private schools.","You may wish to consider a single sex school for a girl. Some research suggests girls may have more chances to be leaders at single sex schools. Most grammar schools, integrated Catholic schools and private schools are single sex.","Some schools offer accelerated programmes for their top students, such as those gifted in mathematics. Williams recalls a 14-year-old boy who had achieved Year 12 maths in Year 10. They advised him to take other subjects for a while &#x201C;but he still snuck in some maths&#x201D;. He later received a scholarship.","<strong>Size may mean more choice</strong>","Some larger schools may offer a wider range of subjects, such as more options in languages and science and more extensive music programmes, for example, than smaller schools. With a good school play, says Williams, &#x201C;students may learn more there than in maths for a few weeks &#x2026; [although] it might be heresy to say it&#x201D;.","Some schools, such as Auckland Grammar and Macleans College, offer the English &#x2018;Cambridge&#x2019; exam system as an alternative to the state&#x2019;s NCEA system.","Consider what your teenager is like. Are they self-disciplined? Many people who are high achievers at school fail their university exams because they are not motivated enough to study unsupervised. And then there is the partying.","<strong>Go Catholic</strong>","Catholic schools are a significant alternative to the state system. According to the Catholic Education Office&#x2019;s website (www.nzceo.catholic.org.nz), New Zealand has 15 Catholic secondary schools and 43 primary schools. Most are smaller than state colleges, although Sacred Heart College (for boys) and Baradene College of the Sacred Heart (for girls) both have rolls of more than 1,200.","Some Catholic schools accept a percentage of students who are not practising Catholics &#x2013; although Catholic Education Office CEO Paul Ferris says it is expected that all students will attend religious classes.","Catholic schools have changed since last century. Some (state-integrated) Catholic schools have first-class facilities &#x2013; arguably better than nearby state schools.","Ferris says only about 40 per cent of teachers are practising Catholics and only a handful of religious staff are still teaching. Most parents are Catholic, but not all practise regularly. Fees are a fraction of those in private schools &#x2013; Ferris says the compulsory element is $800 a term, plus donations, which vary widely.","The Metro magazine schools issue, containing league tables on schools&#x2019; exam results, came out recently.

Sometimes called badges, nano-credentials or nano-degrees, these credentials promise recognition for workforce upskilling and reskilling.","The component of learning undertaken is validated in a micro-credential and is important in itself; it is not simply a stepping stone to any subsequent qualification.","NZQA is currently running a pilot programme (running from 1 August 2017 to 30 June 2018) and is working alongside Otago Polytechnic, The Lion Foundation Young Enterprise Scheme (YES) and Udacity to co-create programmes and ensure that the skills taught align with those deemed essential by employers of the future.","<strong>Exciting potential</strong>","Micro-credentials have exciting potential and may change the direction of tertiary education in New Zealand. It&#x2019;s anticipated that micro-credentials will be deemed invaluable by employers in the future, who will quickly be able to ascertain whether a potential employee has the skills required for a role. Moreover, employers will be able to encourage employees to upskill in a quick and timely manner, should the nature of their roles change.","Micro-credentials are more specific than other tertiary qualifications. They generally require a lower level of commitment and are less intense than a traditional degree programme, but are intended to serve an important role in acknowledging skills that may be otherwise missed in traditional education. Oftentimes micro-credentials can be attained while the recipient continues full-time work or other education, such as secondary schooling.","Whilst still in the preliminary phrases in New Zealand, micro-credentials may be able to offer opportunities for professionals wanting to explore alternative career options and impress employers with more specific knowledge.","<strong>Udacity leads the way</strong>","New Zealand&#x2019;s first micro-credential, issued by Udacity, became available in August 2017. Online education provider Udacity offers a range of nano-degrees and credentials in partnership with international companies including IBM and Mercedes-Benz to provide present- and future-designed courses.","Udacity spotted a gap in educational services and realised a need to acknowledge skills that are not always taught or recognised by traditional training providers. Those who are interested in developing virtual reality applications or exploring robotics may be marginalised by university education but can be accredited through Udacity at the completion of an online course.","Interestingly, the first micro-credential offered in New Zealand by Udacity, announced by Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Phil Goldsmith, is a self-driving car nano-degree. The programme is assessed by NZQA and provides 60 credits at Level 9 of the New Zealand Qualifications Framework. As with any micro-credential, this credential would be documented on an individual&#x2019;s record of learning and could be easily accessed by a potential employer.","<strong>EduBits joins in</strong>","After liaising with NZQA, Otago Polytechnic is now the leading tertiary education provider for micro-credentials in New Zealand, with their micro-credential service, EduBits. Otago Polytechnic and NZQA now jointly award micro-credential EduBits, which recognise sets of skills and knowledge and have the potential to provide ongoing upskilling and reskilling.","NZQA has also been working closely with YES, which will soon begin offering micro-credentials to those taking part in the hands-on learning experience.","Terry Shubkin, Young Enterprise Chief Executive Officer (also known as &#x2018;Chief Excitement Officer&#x2019;), acknowledges it has been important for them to remain relevant and up to date since first beginning the YES in-school programme 36 years ago. She believes micro-credentials are the perfect avenue through which to do this and was thrilled to be able to take part in NZQA&#x2019;s pilot.","<strong>Skills employers want</strong>","&#x201C;YES has morphed over the last 24 years. We recognise those skills that are not necessarily taught in the classroom but are the future [in terms of] what employers are looking for. It&#x2019;s very good that NZQA recognises what employers are saying they are looking for,&#x201D; she says.","YES is hoping to continue its close relationship with NZQA, anticipating that, from July 2018, students completing the YES programme will be issued with 24 Level 3 credits under the NZQA framework.","&#x201C;Currently, YES is only acknowledged as being &#x2018;equivalent credits&#x2019; so it doesn&#x2019;t appear on the record of learning under NZQA, but a micro-credential will appear, so it will be recognised in a broader sense,&#x201D; says Shubkin.","<strong>No need to leave the workforce</strong>","Importantly, such a micro-credential may mean that young New Zealanders don&#x2019;t need to spend three or four years out of the workforce, studying full-time, in order to have recognisable qualifications: &#x201C;We&#x2019;re talking about building lifelong learners, but a lifelong learner isn&#x2019;t always going to stop what they are doing to do a three-year degree,&#x201D; she adds.","YES, which is supported by The Lion Foundation, BP and the Ministry of Youth Development, praises the fact that NZQA is keeping up with the times and leading the way when it comes to formally acknowledging non-traditional forms of education.","&#x201C;We [New Zealand] are definitely keeping up with the global trend of acknowledging learning that is not traditional,&#x201D; says YES Head of Curriculum Yolande Rosario.","Future-focused Shubkin has applauded NZQA for &#x201C;looking to recognise 21st-century skills that are not normally taught in the classroom&#x201D;.","&#x201C;Gone are the days when you needed a multi-year degree,&#x201D; she notes.<br>\nSource: EducationReview.co.nz","Micro-credentials are not simply stepping stones to any subsequent qualifications.

I failed maths and chemistry.&#x201D;","It wasn&#x2019;t until university &#x2013; where he studied neuroscience &#x2013; that he began to understand that it is <em>how</em> you study and the tools you use that have the greatest bearing on learning outcomes and engagement.","So, with friend Hamish Parbhu, Kumar has set out to change that for today&#x2019;s high school students with the creation of QuickSense, a personalised learning tool that ultimately aims to change the way students study.","QuickSense works a bit like this: a student logs in and is provided with questions or problems to solve. Based on how well they answer the questions, QuickSense can gauge where the student&#x2019;s strengths and weaknesses lie. For concepts the student hasn&#x2019;t grasped well yet, the questions will continue at an easier level, but more frequently. For concepts the student is mastering, the questions become more contextualised and based on real-world application. Each student has their own personalised set of questions that are specifically tailored for them.","Meanwhile teachers can see where the individual and collective strengths and weaknesses lie in their classes. Teachers can also see where and why students have made mistakes. Students are given a chance to explain where they think they went wrong and teachers can help drill down into their working.","While QuickSense is aligned with <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em>, its main focus is not so much about teaching to the NCEA exam at the end of the year but more about making learning relevant to various contexts and real-world applications. By taking this approach, better NCEA results&#xA0;typically follow anyway.","&#x201C;QuickSense is flexible enough that it can help students get from &#x2018;Not Achieved&#x2019; all the way to &#x2018;Excellent&#x2019;,&#x201D; says Kumar, &#x201C;At the same time, it&#x2019;s not necessarily about achievement standards but rather about giving students an understanding that their education can be applied to everything in their life.&#x201D;","Research shows that students typically achieve better results when learning is personalised. The duo did their homework before embarking on their new venture.","&#x201C;On average personalised learning helps improve a student&#x2019;s grades by 22 per cent,&#x201D; says Kumar. &#x201C;While this doesn&#x2019;t translate exactly to NCEA, it just shows the power of how designing education around the student can really help the student&#x2019;s learning and engagement.&#x201D;","He&#x2019;s right. There are many examples strewn across New Zealand and overseas to support the case for individualised learning. But the challenge has always been how to make this a reality in a class of kids at all different levels.","&#x201C;In a classroom a teacher often has to teach to the average &#x2013; it&#x2019;s hard to cater for students&#x2019; differing levels of progress. There&#x2019;s not enough flexibility in the classroom for the teacher to say, I&#x2019;m going to create content that&#x2019;s going to challenge you no matter what level you&#x2019;re at&#x2019;.&#x201D;","QuickSense aims to provide a solution for teachers. It is currently operational in STEM-based subjects, but they are looking at rolling out to commerce subjects and eventually to the arts &#x2013; although they are mindful that a different approach might need to be taken for these subjects.","The timing for the launch of a tool like this is spot-on. The NCEA Review is showing all the signs of moving away from &#x2018;teaching to the test&#x2019; and more towards contextualised and individualised project-based learning. QuickSense plays perfectly into this sort of approach.","&#x201C;With the NCEA Review coming up, we know that exams are going to change in some form or another, but what you learn is largely going to remain the same so what we&#x2019;re trying to place the emphasis on not studying for the test, but rather for the context,&#x201D; says Kumar.","They&#x2019;re looking at developing this concept further with a feature called Learning Paths, which allows students to tailor their learning to particular courses, problems or vocations.","For now though, their immediate focus is on getting the nitty gritty right to suit the needs of teachers and students. It appears they&#x2019;re doing something right, owing to the positive feedback they&#x2019;re hearing from schools.","They&#x2019;re currently working with 22 secondary schools, mainly in Auckland, and more recently in Hamilton. They&#x2019;ve had some interest from Wellington schools, too. Macleans College, Green Bay High School, Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate, Epsom Girls&#x2019; Grammar and Hamilton Girls&#x2019; High School are among those to experience QuickSense so far. They hope to work with over 100 schools by next year.","&#x201C;Students love it,&#x201D; says Kumar, &#x201C;It makes it easier to study as well. Right now [study] feels more like a chore than something we care about.&#x201D;","Epsom Girls&#x2019; Grammar teacher Eujine Kim says she is using QuickSense as a &#x201C;do now&#x201D; for her students.","&#x201C;My students like it because it helps them remember what we covered before &#x2013; it&#x2019;s great for retention.","&#x201C;I also like minimal input from teachers to run it &#x2013; we are overloaded as it is! Once we put our course timeline in, then that&#x2019;s it. I monitor students&#x2019; progress every day and I am planning to have short tutoring sessions soon.","&#x201C;There are a few changes or improvements I hope to see but I think it is a great start. Vivek and his team are great too &#x2013; so friendly and efficient!&#x201D;","Kumar says they&#x2019;ve been intrigued with the different approaches to personalised learning and are enjoying learning more themselves.","&#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s really cool to play in this ecosystem of building the future of education.&#x201D;"],"source":{"name":null,"href":null},"tags":["21st Century Learning","innovation","NCEA","technology"]},{"category":"future","title":"Navigating the world of special education","subtitle":"Parents of children with complex needs can vastly improve their children’s chances of educational success. By Anna Clements.","author":"Education Central","date":"September 19, 2018","content":["If you feel as though your school is not well equipped to support your child&#x2019;s special educational needs (SEN), you&#x2019;re probably right. According to international research, disadvantaged students fare considerably worse in the New Zealand education system than those lucky enough to be born in many other countries.","Countless numbers of parents can testify to this. Online support groups are swamped with messages from parents at their wits&#x2019; end as they wrestle with a school system that is not designed or funded for children who learn differently.","&#x201C;Our nine-year-old has very complex needs and was treated very poorly at school,&#x201D; says Lisa, a mother of five in Wellington. &#x201C;He was stood down six times in one term and we were left feeling they had given up on him. On one occasion, the principal lost his cool and tipped a cup of water over [our son&#x2019;s] head.","Lisa&#x2019;s son is intellectually disabled, has autism and two genetic disorders, but was turned down for comprehensive funding known as ORS (Ongoing Resourcing Scheme) because he was judged to be &#x2018;too advanced&#x2019;. At nine, he was working at the level expected of a five-year-old, a year better than required to qualify.","&#x201C;It&#x2019;s absolutely ridiculous, and it&#x2019;s incredibly frustrating that we&#x2019;re having to battle so hard for this child who really needs help. I think it should be a lot easier for parents to access help for their children,&#x201D; says Lisa.","K&#x101;piti parent Shelley Harris shares Lisa&#x2019;s frustration. &#x201C;We have struggles with my daughter [14] who has conductive hearing loss and auditory processing disorder (APD). Because she has APD, she is always excluded from any help. Like most deaf students in New Zealand, she cannot access sign language, despite the fact it is an official language of our country. This is sheer discrimination and a breach of their human rights.","&#x201C;As it is, you have to put your child into a school environment with teachers who are not necessarily skilled to work with special needs students and you have to hope that they are invested in your child.","&#x201C;Her school is very good, probably because I made a lot of noise about her. If I was a mum who left it to the school, I think her outcomes might be very different.","&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not an equal or fair chance in education for children like her. All the systems involved in their lives are broken.&#x201D;","These stories are echoed throughout the communities of Aotearoa. There is a profound sense of exclusion and injustice experienced by many families whose children do not fit into mainstream education.","But there are flecks of light beaming through the darkness. Some schools, such as Greerton Village School in Tauranga, are doing magnificent work with children who have special educational needs.","Greerton is a mainstream primary with a roll of 415 students. Of those, 25 students &#x2013; or six per cent &#x2013; are ORS-funded, compared with one per cent nationally. A further 15 students are funded for additional support, making Greerton something of an anomaly.","Erika Harvey drives her daughter, Piper, across town to Greerton because of its stellar reputation.","&#x201C;Greerton is absolutely amazing. The special needs children are included in everything mainstream and the staff are absolutely committed to helping them progress. The teacher aides are like nurses: they even change feeding pegs and teach toileting.&#x201D;","Piper is seven and has been diagnosed with non-verbal autism. Before starting at Greerton, she did not speak and could only express her unhappiness by screaming and through violence. At times she would smash her head against concrete and attack those around her.","But in the space of two years, Piper&#x2019;s progress has been such that she is learning to speak and even performed a karakia in front of a crowd at a recent public event.","&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t speak highly enough about our experience with my daughter&#x2019;s school,&#x201D; says Erika. &#x201C;Support has been outstanding. She feels liked and included, and she thinks everyone is her friend. She has made drastic improvements from being fully supported in an inclusive education system, and as much as she learns at school and from other students, they also learn from her and understand that we are all different, but all special in our own ways.&#x201D;","Buoyed by the support provided at Greerton, Erika has set up &#x2018;Power in Numbers&#x2019;, a group of parent advocates striving for equity in education and a funding model that supports it.","&#x201C;I never realised how hard it was for kids with SEN or behavioural problems; it&#x2019;s really heartbreaking. Parents need to arm themselves with knowledge and processes they need to follow for success in equity and inclusion at their local school.&#x201D;","First of all, says Erika, parents should educate themselves about their rights within the New Zealand education system. Then they will know what they can and cannot rightfully expect.","Parents who feel that their child is being excluded or treated unfairly at school are advised to nominate a support person to attend school meetings with them, as this relieves a lot of the stress and anxiety. Erika says the ideal support person is a parent who has been down the SEN route before.","If this approach is unsuccessful, Erika advises parents firstly to request, in writing, a copy of the school&#x2019;s complaints policy. Secondly, ensure that all communication is received in writing and follows the procedure outlined by the school. After following this procedure, if parents feel things have not been addressed appropriately, they should connect with Power in Numbers on Facebook or make contact with Youth Law for free legal advice.","Erika points to Section 8 of the Education Act which guarantees rights to special education,<br>\nand Article 24 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities as evidence that the state is obligated to assist with applications for funding assistance, ORS, and must take reasonable steps to accommodate the education needs of disabled people.","In simple terms, this means that the school and Ministry should be creating solutions so that children who need additional support in school are able to access education. Failure to do so amounts to discrimination and violates a child&#x2019;s rights to a quality and inclusive education; this is a legal violation even if funding doesn&#x2019;t allow it to happen.","Back in Wellington, Lisa has removed her son from the school where the principal tipped water over his head and he is now happy at a different school where his teacher is kind and understanding.","&#x201C;His new school is incredibly welcoming and his teacher is very patient,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;They take time to understand how he ticks, and don&#x2019;t expect him to work in the same way as other kids.","&#x201C;The difference in him is monumental. He&#x2019;s made a friend and even had a sleepover. At his last school, he didn&#x2019;t have any friends and other families talked very negatively about us as a family. But now he&#x2019;s happy to go to school, he feels liked and everyone says hello and hugs him.&#x201D;","Lisa has learnt another big lesson &#x2013; to apply for ORS funding early. Her younger son has similarly complex needs and, at four, has been approved for ORS. This means that funding is guaranteed for his entire time at school, and that he will follow a curriculum individually tailored to his needs.","Why the difference in funding for the brothers? Says Lisa, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s all about timing. If you apply for funding before they start school, you have a much better chance of success.&#x201D;"],"source":{"name":null,"href":null},"tags":["FutureFocus"]},{"category":"future","title":"Preschoolers and technology","subtitle":"How much digital technology should children be exposed to in their early childhood education years?

Over three-quarters of four-year-olds in the study were using electronic media other than television on a &#x2018;usual weekday&#x2019;. When added to time spent watching TV, these children were in front of a screen an average of 2.1 hours per day, as reported by their mothers, up from 1.6 hours when they were two.","Although there are rules around screen time for most of these children, this figure exceeds Ministry of Health guidelines, which advocate no screen time at all for under-twos and a limit of one hour per day for children aged two to five.","These guidelines align with recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, which maintain, &#x201C;&#x2026;multiple developmental and health concerns continue to exist for young children using all forms of digital media to excess&#x201D;.","So what are parents and teachers to do when faced with this kind of information on the one hand and urgings on the other about the need to equip children for the 21st century?","In the face of government policies promoting the integrated use of digital technologies in learning and a belief they can support language development and mathematical thinking, many early childhood education (ECE) centres are incorporating digital devices, such as iPads, into learning.","&#x201C;Technology is all around children,&#x201D; says Clare Wells, chief executive of New Zealand Kindergartens. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a prominent feature in their lives every day so it&#x2019;s not surprising technology is also used at kindergarten.&#x201D;","She says children use technology in kindergartens as a tool to explore and make sense of their world &#x2013; perhaps to research an area of interest with a teacher or to develop their knowledge and understanding.","Devices are also used to build skills and dispositions, says Wells, with children engaging in online activities that encourage concentration or perseverance or show them how to deal with emergencies and difficult situations.","&#x201C;Teachers use their professional judgement and provide a range of opportunities and experiences for children to progress their learning, one of which will be through the use of technology.&#x201D;","<strong>Bucking the trend</strong>","Mindful of the fact most children spend time on devices at home, some centres such as The Cottage Kindergarten in Waimauku have chosen to be screen-free. The private kindergarten, which has a clear philosophy focused on learning through play, recently surveyed parents to ensure a screen-free centre was what they wanted.","&#x201C;A lot of professional learning is coming out around the use of technology and we were beginning to wonder if we were in the Dark Ages,&#x201D; says managing teacher Sara Stewart. &#x201C;But pretty much 100 per cent of parents said &#x2018;no, [we don&#x2019;t want devices]; that&#x2019;s why we come to you&#x2019;.&#x201D;","While Playcentre doesn&#x2019;t have a policy on the use of technology, most centres choose to be screen-free, with sessions focused on child-led free play.","Charlotte Thynne has a PhD in neurophysiology and attends Playcentre in Nelson with her daughters. She believes children learn best when they have the time and the space to explore their environment and interact with adults and children when they want to.","&#x201C;I think that, in a way, a device leads the child, with flashing things to be pressed and commands to be followed &#x2026; it is almost the antithesis of child-led learning,&#x201D; says Thynne.","In her opinion, digital devices in ECE &#x201C;offer no benefits for children at best and are damaging at worse&#x201D;.","Devices are also limited by the fact they can only stimulate two of the senses &#x2013; sight and sound &#x2013; &#x201C;and over-stimulate them at that&#x201D;.","&#x201C;Children want to experience and learn through all their senses, as we see in Playcentre when they eat the sand or the slime, smear it up their arms and mix up potions from the garden to be sniffed and observed,&#x201D; she says.","Keryn O&#x2019;Neill, senior researcher at Brainwave Trust Aotearoa, agrees that children don&#x2019;t need devices in the early years for brain development and learning.","&#x201C;Technology is changing, but what children need hasn&#x2019;t changed,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Unstructured free play, real everyday experiences, interacting with adults, talking and playing with other children, that&#x2019;s how children learn best.&#x201D;","One of the main downsides of children spending too much time on devices is that they miss out on valuable time spent doing these things, says O&#x2019;Neill. &#x201C;Young children, in particular, need interaction with another human being, not a screen.&#x201D;","<strong>Amount of time matters</strong>","But before you beat yourself up about handing your three-year-old your iPad for 15 minutes while you make a phone call, O&#x2019;Neill says there&#x2019;s a big difference between this kind of use and children spending a few hours a day in front of a screen. &#x201C;Like most things in child development, the amount of time matters.&#x201D;","Time spent in physical activity can also be compromised if too much time is spent in front of a screen, reports a 2016 University of Auckland study, which suggests ECE services could be doing more to monitor screen use and encourage children to<br>\nbe active.","PhD student Sarah Gerritsen found that children watched television &#x2018;daily&#x2019; in two per cent of the centres she surveyed, and &#x2018;weekly&#x2019; in 11 per cent, and used computers every day in 11 per cent and weekly in 22 per cent. Only 35 per cent of the centres had a written physical activity policy, and no centres had policies addressing screen use.","An advocate for the use of technology in education, primary school teacher Anna Tollestrup believes technology can play &#x201C;a huge role&#x201D; in enhancing learning and engaging children, particularly boys.","She says digital learning isn&#x2019;t just about putting a device in front of a child and pushing the on button. &#x201C;There are hours spent behind the scenes searching for the right technology for the desired outcome.&#x201D;","Anna believes engaging children with technology in the early years of primary school helps prepare them for a fast-paced online world.","&#x201C;Not only do we teach the fundamental skills &#x2026; but coding, robotics and film making, the process of making something move. We do that from [the age of] five because it is fun, engaging and a necessary skill in tomorrow&#x2019;s future-focused classrooms.&#x201D;","However, Charlotte disagrees that children need to be exposed to digital technology at an early age to become proficient users.

You know, &#x2018;I put it on the portal&#x2026;&#x2019;.&#xA0; I have so many portals and apps and passwords though and once you have kids at different schools there&#x2019;s a whole new portal to remember and access,&#x201D; she says.","&#x201C;I&#x2019;m just so overrun with information and questions and payments and requests that I just check out from time to time. I am sure this has happened all through the ages before technology connected us.&#x201D;","Harris would prefer the schools used Facebook a little better for communication, but says the issue may be as much about the fatigue of parenting and working as it is about schools&#x2019; communication methods.","&#x201C;Neither of them really do, but I wonder if that&#x2019;s because that&#x2019;s how I have got used to receiving my information. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be nice if there was a portal that multiple schools could use? I could use one login and have access to both kids &#x2013; this probably already exists!&#x201D;","The biggest provider of school-related communication apps in New Zealand, School Apps, began five years ago when a Hawke&#x2019;s Bay school approached a development agency to create a communication tool.","Another app, Skool Loop, was created by Kaikoura-based parent Sharlene Barnes after her son introduced her to the existence of smartphone apps in 2012.","&#x201C;Getting permission forms back to teachers is no longer the paper trail it used to be. All you need to do is sign the form with a swipe of your finger and it will electronically notify your child&#x2019;s school or teacher that they are allowed to go on that field trip &#x2013; the form for which your child may have lost to the abyss of the backpack a week ago,&#x201D; says Barnes.","With different schools adopting different channels to suit their communities, perhaps we are in a transition stage between old and new communication methods between schools and parents.

There&#x2019;s a lot more technology in class, and a variety of furniture, including beanbags and lily pads (vinyl soft seats), and far fewer tables and chairs.","According to a 2017 study by the University of Melbourne, ILE learning takes place in about one-third of New Zealand primary settings. The Ministry estimates it spent $747.7 million on 19 new ILE schools between 2013 and 2017.","But there are deep divisions over how successful these classrooms are, and whether enough evidence exists to support such a big change.","ILE supporters argue that &#x2018;21st century learners&#x2019; need to be resilient, lifelong students who can, as a 2009 UK study puts it, &#x201C;think and work in teams and be flexible, adaptable and creative&#x201D;.","All schools must follow the national curriculum, but it is up to each school to determine the best teaching and learning approaches for its students, says Shannon.","<strong>Concerns with modern learning approaches</strong>","Not all parents are happy when their local school embraces ILE-style education. Some are concerned about the psychological and physical impact of electronic devices, including sleep and vision issues, loss of handwriting skills and musculoskeletal effects.","There&#x2019;s also a simple lack of chairs, which parents say can lead to problems.","Lucy&#x2019;s* son, in Year 4, has suffered severe headaches since moving to an ILE last year.

Research shows that the more opportunities children have to learn through a play-based curriculum in the early years, the better the future results in formal education. Some experts believe that preschool children who experience a high amount of formal learning can be disadvantaged, simply because their self-expressed play time is less. Further, they argue that the early years are the most vital in a person&#x2019;s learning journey, and that this is where parents should focus their resources &#x2013; even more so than university.","Jack&#x2019;s dad wondered what value Jack&#x2019;s teachers were adding to Jack&#x2019;s learning. To him, the teachers were simply keeping the children at Jack&#x2019;s centre entertained and safe. In fact, qualified early childhood teachers have three-year degrees and are skilled in provoking meaningful learning through play, extending on children&#x2019;s interests with the view to supporting them to develop new knowledge, skills and provide opportunities to help them reflect on &#x2018;how they learn&#x2019;.

Often, the feelings of anxiety continue long past the new entrant stage into the junior school years, with some parents seeking private tutors to promote &#x2018;proper learning&#x2019; outside of school.","It may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that probably the best thing you can do for your child&#x2019;s education is to ensure they get plenty of playtime.","<strong>Play IS learning</strong>","Play isn&#x2019;t some sort of soft approach before the &#x2018;real&#x2019; learning begins, says early childhood education expert Viv Shearsby. Play <em>is</em> learning, children are the experts &#x2013; and all teachers should provide playtime every day.","&#x201C;We know young children are expert learners. They are hardwired to do this, and recent advances in brain development research now showcases the importance of this. It is particularly vigorous in the first three to five years. Creative or divergent thinking sits at 98 per cent for those under five, but evidence clearly shows the decline of this consistently throughout childhood with a massive reduction in creative thinking processes by exit of the school context.&#x201D;","Bearing this in mind, it is unsurprising to learn that in Finland, whose state school system has sat at the top of Europe&#x2019;s rankings for the past 16 years, the groundwork for good school performance begins with play-based learning in early childhood centres.","In Finnish daycare centres, designed for children up to age seven, the main purpose is the promotion of health and wellbeing of the child. Children are taught how to develop good social habits such as making friends and maintaining personal hygiene, and at least 90 minutes a day is devoted to physical activity outside.","Nevertheless, play is taken very seriously because it provides children with vital skills in how to learn. By engaging in &#x2018;free play&#x2019; and teacher-directed play, children develop skills in paying attention, persevering, concentrating and solving problems, qualities that are considered stronger predictors of academic success than the age at which a child learns to read.","&#x201C;When children have opportunities to play at length and be involved with others in investigating possibilities and developing hypotheses, they try things out. They have little fear of failure, and through ongoing and recurring experiences they secure brain synapses that form the framework of their learned knowledge. Over time their competence increases, and with this they develop confidence in their capability. Play allows children to be relaxed and work creatively, revisit experiences, solve problems, engage with others and discover an endlessly new world,&#x201D; says Shearsby.","Early years care in Finland is highly subsidised to ensure accessibility to all children. At age five, 75 per cent of Finnish children are in daycare and by six, the uptake is 98 per cent. There is no academic focus, and no formal instruction of maths, reading or writing. Instead the goal is ensuring that the children are happy and responsible.","Many New Zealand-based child advocates believe it should be a similar system here. While the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Wh</em>&#x101;<em>riki</em>, is highly regarded internationally, transition-to-school programmes are less successful and the difference between preschool and primary environments much more pronounced.","As it is, many children&#x2019;s experience of starting school in New Zealand is punctuated by the shock of bells, rules and spending long periods of time sitting down.","<strong>One school&#x2019;s experience with play-based learning</strong>","However, some schools in New Zealand are adopting Play-Based Learning (PBL) &#x2013; with very positive results. Kaimai School, a small rural primary school near Tauranga, introduced PBL at the beginning of 2018.","Dane Robertson, the school&#x2019;s former principal who initiated its transition to PBL, says the first noticeable change was improvement of social interactions between children.","&#x201C;The children began to solve their own problems and fewer would come to me with small issues; they began to self-police their own behaviour.&#x201D;","In the classroom, teachers reported that children were better engaged in reading, writing, and maths groups, and were more confident to give things a go.","Indeed, risk-taking is central to healthy child development and to this end Kaimai raised $130,000 to finance a skate park, an investment that Robertson says quickly paid dividends.","Within a term, children were observed to develop confidence, patience, perseverance, calculated risk taking, and resilience.","&#x201C;All these personality traits are hugely important in adulthood, and the only way this can be achieved is to offer these experiences for children in a controlled environment.&#x201D;","Students are allowed to play bullrush, climb trees and make huts, and plans are afoot to build a wooden barn for storage of tyres, scaffolding planks and wooden climbing boxes. There is also a wish list of items such as a mud kitchen and a fire pit.","Kaimai&#x2019;s change in approach came about after Robertson read of schools in Colorado where schooling had been reduced to four days a week because of a funding crisis. Astonishingly the impact on the children&#x2019;s achievement had been positive, it was thought because children were able to be involved in play of their choice on the fifth day. Less school led to better results.","Reading this prompted Robertson to revisit the work of Swiss psychologist and child development expert, Jean Piaget. Piaget&#x2019;s theory of cognitive development and epistemological view are together called &#x2018;genetic epistemology&#x2019;, and some of his research led to the belief that every interaction establishes cognitive structure in children. This is said to be especially important in the classroom environment.","In 2017, Kaimai staff had professional development with the Brainwave Trust and Nathan Mikaere-Wallis which focused on neuroscience and how the brain works. They learned that at about age seven, the longitudinal fissure (the area where the left and right hemispheres join) strengthens and each hemisphere starts to take on a more dominant role. This is when the brain becomes far more receptive to higher order tasks such as reading, writing, and maths.","Following that, there was professional development with teacher and author Pennie Brownlee, and Longworth Education.","At Kaimai, junior classes still have the focus of reading, writing, and maths, but follow-up activities have often been replaced with free play. The teacher will put out invitations or &#x2018;provocations&#x2019;, that are open-ended starting points for play.","Ideally, the items set up for play are natural materials, allowing students to link with nature and use their imaginations;&#xA0; an example being that a plastic apple in a play kitchen will only be played with as an apple, whilst a pinecone could be an apple, an egg or a bottle of tomato sauce.","&#x201C;My findings are that Play-Based Learning is not something that a teacher just does; rather, it is a pedagogical approach to teaching, it is a philosophy that can be backed up through neuroscience, educational theorists and research,&#x201D; says Robertson.","The school&#x2019;s approach is to look at the whole student.","&#x201C;We fell down the rabbit hole of focusing on students who were struggling in reading, writing, and maths. Late last year we realised we had not looked carefully at the whole student, as we had students who in the areas of reading, writing, and maths were at, or mostly beyond, their expected levels but had huge social gaps.&#x201D;","Students&#x2019; academic progress is still a focus, but teachers also consider where they are at with regards to cognitive stages.","&#x201C;Play is an easy way for teachers to observe the key competencies in real situations, which are student-led and student-focused.&#x201D;","Kaimai is now investigating what PBL looks like in middle and senior classes with students participating in inquiry projects known as DIY. Teaching is focused on the process rather than the product, and inquiry time is treated more like play.","<strong>They are mindful of the definition of play as defined by eminent Boston psychologist, Peter Gray:</strong>","<em>&#x201C;Play by definition, is, first and foremost, an activity that is self-chosen and self-directed. It is an activity that you are always free to quit.

National Standards measured whether students were &#x2018;above&#x2019;, &#x2018;at&#x2019; or &#x2018;below&#x2019; the expected level for reading, writing and maths.","&#x201C;They&#x2019;re not national and they&#x2019;re not standard,&#x201D; Hipkins said, before Labour was elected and he became Education Minister.","&#x201C;National Standards don&#x2019;t measure progress; they fail to recognise that different kids learn differently and at different rates.&#x201D;","Hipkins also took exception to the way the Standards narrowed the curriculum to reading, writing and maths, often at the expense of other curriculum areas.","Last year, Education Central canvassed teachers to find Hipkins&#x2019; views echoed those of many teachers.","Jess Byrne felt National Standards weren&#x2019;t an accurate measure &#x2013; particularly for our youngest students.","&#x201C;I am also very concerned that for our most vulnerable students these measures could be very detrimental to their self-esteem. They clearly highlight the student&#x2019;s deficits and take away any recognition of strengths in other learning areas.&#x201D;","&#x201C;The language of &#x2018;above&#x2019;, &#x2018;at&#x2019; or &#x2018;below&#x2019; the standard is just cruel,&#x201D; agreed Sheherazad Bhote, who also had concerns that National Standards didn&#x2019;t support the idea that children learn at their own speed.","Many educators also resented the fact that National Standards data could be used to publicly compare schools, as this opened up the possibility of discrimination against children with English as a second language or special learning needs who might &#x2018;skew&#x2019; the data.","There is broad agreement in education circles that the emphasis should be on an individual student&#x2019;s progress, rather than reaching an arbitrary standard. It&#x2019;s hard to argue with that. All parents want to see progression in their child&#x2019;s learning, regardless of whether they are struggling or gifted. After all, an &#x2018;above&#x2019; measure, while reassuring, doesn&#x2019;t tell you all that much about whether your child has made any improvement.","The challenge for schools is how to demonstrate this progress to parents.","Hipkins says that rather than relying on one tool, teachers can use a range of assessment tools to understand students&#x2019; progress across the full curricula. Schools have generally been doing this for some time anyway and many insist that it is a case of &#x2018;business as usual&#x2019; in the new post-National Standards era.","Yet there will be parents all around New Zealand, just like me, searching school reports for answers to the key questions: Are my children making progress? Are they where they should be? And of course, are they decent little human beings?","Upon closer reading, I found all the answers I was seeking. The report was crammed with detail about what he was learning, how he was performing against the school competencies, and his next learning steps.","But is this merely good fortune that the school has worked hard to establish a new and effective system of reporting to parents? With no clear guidance from the Ministry of Education, schools are left grappling with how to forge their own way.","Some have opted simply to continue with a system based largely on the National Standards system. Others have used the opportunity to delve into other learning areas and competencies of the curriculum and measure against those.","A number of schools are supplementing the formal twice-yearly reports with real-time reporting to parents with apps like Linc-Ed and SeeSaw.","The biggest challenge for schools, as they wean parents off National Standards, will be to find a way that works for them and their community to clearly articulate children&#x2019;s progress and a sense of whether they&#x2019;re achieving at the expected level."],"source":{"name":null,"href":null},"tags":["FutureFocus"]},{"category":"future","title":"Smooth transitions","subtitle":"What does it take to make a good transition from early childhood education to school, and from primary to intermediate or secondary school? By Rachel Helyer Donaldson.","author":"Education Central","date":"September 21, 2018","content":["As George&#x2019;s fifth birthday approached, in March, his mum Megan assumed he would be pretty relaxed about starting school. The third child, he&#x2019;d spent a lot of time there already, accompanying his two older siblings on drop-offs and pick-ups. His kindergarten had helped him prepare by encouraging independence and talking about school.","So she was surprised when George became &#x201C;very nervous&#x201D;, she says. &#x201C;He displayed a fair bit of anxiety leading up to it, lots of tears and trouble getting to sleep at night.&#x201D;","Things resolved after the second of two school visits &#x2013; &#x201C;interestingly, the one where I didn&#x2019;t stay!&#x201D;","George&#x2019;s teacher put him at ease with a calm and positive classroom environment. He could now enjoy his last week of kindy, including his &#x2018;happy last day&#x2019; ceremony, and looked forward to starting school.","This year, George&#x2019;s 12-year-old brother Max also started senior school, in Year 7. Although Max was not going to a completely new school, the transition is definitely seen as a big step, Megan says.","&#x201C;The kids step up to a much larger position of responsibility in the school community. It&#x2019;s a notable transition with homework expectations and leadership opportunities.&#x201D;","While very different, starting primary school and moving on to intermediate (or secondary school, if primary goes up to Year 8) are two massive milestones in a child&#x2019;s life. As Kahli Oliveira, a Year 1 team leader at Mt Albert&#x2019;s Gladstone Primary School, who has also taught intermediate children for eight years in Gisborne, puts it: new entrants&#x2019; classes are &#x201C;the beginning of it all&#x201D; while intermediate is &#x201C;a time of transformation, when children tend to grow up&#x201D;.","The <em>New Zealand Curriculum</em> describes those middle school years as &#x201C;a time of great change for learners as they move from childhood to adolescence&#x201D;. Most of these children also transition between different school settings.","For five-year-olds turning up on their first day of school, there is no expectation to know how to read or write. &#x2018;School ready&#x2019; children can manage themselves and their belongings, says Nicky Edwards, a new entrants&#x2019; teacher at Halswell School in Christchurch.","This includes being able to go to the toilet on their own, blow their own noses and follow a simple routine, like getting their reading book and water bottle out at the start of the day, or packing their bag at the end. Social skills, like knowing how to share, take turns and ask an adult for help, are also useful, she adds.","Gladstone Primary School fosters a &#x2018;can-do&#x2019; attitude among its new entrants, says Oliveira.","&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the ability to try something new without it being too scary, or overwhelming or thinking that it&#x2019;s not the right way to do things. Just knowing that teachers and parents have got your back; we&#x2019;re there to help them but we&#x2019;re not going to do it for them.&#x201D;","Basic literacy and numeracy skills are useful but not essential, says Edwards. &#x201C;We test early in a fun environment and teach from where the children are at.&#x201D;","But, she adds, if a child is developmentally ready to learn, &#x201C;then they really take off when they are exposed to this learning when they start school&#x201D;.","A significant Australian study, <em>Starting School</em>, observes that schools need to be ready for children, not the other way around. Gladstone, which has a diverse ethnic community and wide-ranging learning needs, follows a similar philosophy, says Oliveira.","&#x201C;Some children are really ready to start school; some would rather be playing with the blocks and in the sandpit. As Year 0 and 1 teachers, we have to be responsive and tailor our programmes to meet those needs. Each child makes individual progress, no matter where they start.&#x201D;","It&#x2019;s worth remembering you can choose to start a child any time up to a year later, when they turn six. &#x201C;Children who are &#x2018;not school ready&#x2019; tend to need a lot of support to manage their day,&#x201D; says Edwards. But, she adds, &#x201C;they can really enjoy being in the school environment, particularly if it has a play-based environment&#x201D;.","Families can help a child before they start school by visiting outside school hours to have a play and get familiar with the environment, says Edwards. Having positive conversations about starting school and encouraging self-management skills, such as packing and carrying their own bags, all help too.","&#x201C;Our contributing ECEs [early childhood education centres] are brilliant and prepare the children well,&#x201D; she adds.","Both teachers agree that pre-school visits are crucial. Halswell offers three visits while Gladstone provides between four and six. Parents stay initially with the child, but there are children-only visits too, as well as information sessions for the adults.","If new entrants feel a strong connection between home and school, they feel safe and they&#x2019;re going to learn, says Oliveira. &#x201C;We want those little people to believe in themselves. Enjoying school is paramount.&#x201D;","Adolescents starting at intermediate have different challenges. They&#x2019;re no longer the self-assured, Year 6 &#x2018;big kids&#x2019; at primary, but Year 7 newbies. Along with the sheer number of new students all starting at the same time, the other major difference, says Glenfield Intermediate principal Mark Whitford, is &#x201C;the social, emotional and physiological changes that young adolescents experience during this time&#x201D;.","A successful transition is essential to ensure there is no negative impact on learning, he says. The key is &#x201C;building a positive rapport and relationship with the learner and family as soon as possible, and providing a variety of opportunities to visit the intermediate&#x201D;. Connections with local primary schools are also crucial, he adds.","As early as Term 2, Year 6 students from the local primaries spend a day at Glenfield meeting teachers and trying out different classes. There are open evenings, an outing to see Glenfield&#x2019;s school production, and other special events.","Whitfield urges families to take up any chances they can to visit the intermediate.","&#x201C;Parents can also help by celebrating the transition as an important stepping-stone into the next phase of education. The more positive parents are, the more likely the children are to be positive about the move.&#x201D;"],"source":{"name":null,"href":null},"tags":["FutureFocus"]}]]
